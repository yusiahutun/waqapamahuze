Thankfully, Outplayed can automatically capture highlights with any graphics card brand.</p><h2 id=why-most-highlight-capture-apps-are-bad>Why Most Highlight Capture Apps Are Bad</h2><p>If you’ve ever heard of the term “clip it”, you’ll know that there really isn’t a game capture app that can just do that for you automatically. Nvidia's GeForce Experience can automatically capture highlights, but there are two major downsides to it: only a few popular games support it and you need an Nvidia GPU.</p><p>While you can <a href=#>record gameplay on Windows</a>, most alternative highlighting apps require you to press a hotkey to record the past few seconds or minutes. This can easily be forgotten when you’re focused on the game.</p><p>Some highlight apps tag highlights, but they require you to record the entire session. This leaves you with a huge file and needing to sort through the footage to find which clip is from which match.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-use-outplayed-for-game-highlights-recording>How to Use Outplayed for Game Highlights Recording</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/outplayed-logo-on-white-background.jpg><p>Of the many highlight apps I’ve tried, Outplayed does it better than any other. It uses event-based capturing; like capturing deaths, knockdowns, and headshots.</p><p>It also comes with a user interface that opens up after your gaming session so that you can edit, save, and upload everything from the app. There's barely any performance hit, though lower-end systems may feel an impact.</p><p>Nvidia requires the developers to implement the highlighting feature in their game, but Outplayed's software can recognize those in-game events. That's how Outplayed supports over 2,000 games, with its community voting on the next game to add support to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=install-outplayed>1.

This means that if the game you play is popular and has your usual kill, death, and assist events; it probably supports it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When launching a game for the first time, a pop-up will appear prompting you to choose whether you want to record the entire session, record it manually, or use automatic recording if it supports it. This can get annoying, but you can turn it off in the <strong>Notifications</strong> tab on the upper left in the settings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/supported-auto-capture-events-in-outplayed.jpg><p>You can check the settings and click the <strong>+</strong> button and search for your game if Outplayed hasn’t detected it already. If you click on your game on <strong>My Games</strong> list, it should have an <strong>Auto captured events</strong> section if Outplayed supports it for the game.</p><p>For example, Apex Legends has eight events that can trigger auto-capturing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While you’re in the settings, you might want to turn off <strong>Open Outplayed when game ends</strong> in case that feature annoys you. However, I find it convenient so I don’t forget to save good clips.</p><h3 id=customize-your-highlight-events>3.

In the game’s settings, click on <strong>Advanced options</strong> to open up the event sliders and choose how long you want the before and after duration to be. Though, most of the time, the default settings are pretty good.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/storage-auto-manage-in-outplayed.jpg><p>If you’re worried about storage with all the automatic recording, you can set a storage limit. It’ll delete the oldest clip once it passes the limit. Don’t worry, you can favorite a clip by clicking the <strong>star icon</strong> so that it won’t get deleted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/star-and-folder-icons-in-outplayed.jpg><h3 id=review-save-or-edit-your-highlights>4.
