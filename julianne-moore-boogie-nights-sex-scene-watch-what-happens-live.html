"So usually there are other actors not present and one of the things that was really weird about 'Boogie Nights' was that there were all these other actors there too!"</p><p>"Mark [Wahlberg] and I were doing this scene but then you pulled back and everybody else was watching us do the scene," she continued."That was challenging because of the size of the audience."</p><p>Later in the show, the red-haired beauty got even more candid when the host played a fun game of "hypothetical situations" with his guests.</p><p>Cohen asked Julianne who she would give her second kidney to -- <strong>"Still Alice"</strong> costar <strong>Kristen </strong><strong>Stewart</strong> or <strong>"Maps to the Stars"</strong> costar <strong>Robert </strong><strong>Pattinson.</strong></p><p><span>"I'm gonna go with Kristen," she laughed. "<span>She was in a movie with my husband when she was 12 years old," she added. "And <strong>Bart [Freundlich] </strong>would come home from work and say, 'This girl is amazing, she's a star, she's such a great actor, I can't believe it.'"</span></span></p><p><span><span></span><span>What do you think of Julianne's candid comments?
