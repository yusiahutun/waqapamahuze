However, playing them on iPads with the latest Apple Silicon offers significant benefits in one way or another. We've chosen a list of games that can take advantage of your tablet's power to bring them close to or even equal to the console or PC versions of these games. They offer console-grade gaming on the go without the compromises of weaker mobile devices or handheld consoles such as the Nintendo Switch.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Games You Won't Believe Your M1 or M2 Mac Can Run</a></span></p><h2 id=xcom-2-collection><a href=#>XCOM 2 Collection</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>XCOM 2&nbsp;is a turn-based tactical strategy game that was originally released for PC and consoles in 2016. The XCOM 2 Collection ($19.99) is a bundle that includes the base game and all of the expansions and downloadable content that have been released for it.</p><p>In the game, players take on the role of the leader of a group of soldiers fighting against an alien invasion. Players must manage resources, research new technologies, and build and upgrade their base to better equip their soldiers for the fight. They must also make strategic decisions on the battlefield, choosing the right tactics and positioning their soldiers to take on the enemy.</p><p>In 2021 the game received an update with a new graphics-focused mode for more powerful iPads, bringing it closer to the console version's graphics fidelity. With an M1 or M2 device, you can have both fluid gameplay, fast AI turns, and crisp, detailed graphics. There's no need to compromise.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=#>App Store Download</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=civilization-vi><a href=#>Civilization VI</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3-1.jpg><p>Civilization VI&nbsp;(free to play) is a turn-based strategy game that was originally released for PC in 2016 and later released for mobile devices, including iPad. The game is set in the modern world and allows players to lead a civilization from the ground up, starting in ancient times and advancing through different eras of history.</p><p>In Civilization VI, players must build and manage their own cities, research new technologies, and engage in diplomacy or warfare with other civilizations. The game features a variety of leaders and civilizations to choose from, each with their own unique abilities and characteristics.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>You Should Play These Retro PC Games on Your M1 or M2 Mac</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Graphically, Civilization VI isn't much to write home about. The game is attractive, but not that demanding on GPUs regardless of platform. Sadly, at the time of writing, the iPad version does not include the lovely pre-rendered leader animations, but otherwise the game is completely intact. So why is playing this on Apple Silicon iPads a big deal?</p><p>It all comes down to CPU performance. Civ 6 can bog down even powerful desktop CPUs, especially in the late game. It's not fun sitting for minutes on end as your AI opponents slowly think through their next move. On an M1 or better, you turn comes so much faster and that makes a huge difference to how enjoyable a 4X game live Civ is.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=#>App Store Download</a></span></p><h2 id=alien-isolation><a href=#>Alien: Isolation</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/4.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alien: Isolation&nbsp;($14.99) is a survival horror game that was originally released for PC and consoles in 2014. The game is set in the universe of the Alien film franchise and follows the story of Amanda Ripley, the daughter of Ellen Ripley, as she tries to survive on a space station overrun by a deadly alien creature.</p><p>In Alien: Isolation, players must use stealth and problem-solving skills to evade the alien and outsmart other dangerous threats on the space station, such as malfunctioning machines and hostile human survivors. The game features a first-person perspective and a focus on atmosphere and tension, with limited resources and a reliance on hiding and distracting the alien to survive.</p><p>The mobile version of this game impresses on any mobile device capable of running it, but on an M1 or M2 it's as good (if not better) than running the game on a last-gen console such as the PlayStation 4, with the "performance" graphics preset offering amazing fluidity on iPads.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=#>App Store Download</a></span></p><h2 id=divinity-original-sin-2><a href=#>Divinity Original Sin 2</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/5.jpg><p>Divinity: Original Sin 2&nbsp;($24.99) is a role-playing game that was originally released for PC in 2017 and later released for consoles and mobile devices, including iPad.

Playing it on an M2 iPad, and the game looks like its painted onto the other side of the glass. It's the definitive way to play Original Sin 2 on the go and stands up against the PC version in terms of fluidity and detail.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=#>App Store Download</a></span></p><h2 id=grid-autosport><a href=#>GRID AutoSport</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6.jpg><p>GRID Autosport&nbsp;($9.99) is a racing game that was originally released for PC and consoles in 2014. The game features a wide variety of racing disciplines, including touring cars, GT, endurance, open-wheel, street racing, and more.

The game is known for its realistic handling and damage model, as well as its immersive and atmospheric presentation.</p><p>This is another game that runs rather well on a device like the 2018 iPad Pro and scales well on most devices, but in its 120fps performance mode the M1 or M2 takes the game to the next level. High frame rates are especially useful in racing games such as GRID Autosport and with the extra grunt of the latest chips you'll get a much more consistent output at that target rate. Of course, this only applies to <a href=#>iPad Pros</a> with 120hz screens, but even if you lock the game to 60fps, it looks utterly gorgeous.
