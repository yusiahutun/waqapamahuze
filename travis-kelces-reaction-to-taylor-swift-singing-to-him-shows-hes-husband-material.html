There’s too much to unpack!</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> have been spotted out and about for months, and it looks like they’ve now made it fully official, as karma is the guy on the Chiefs, after all.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1738322026-2-1024x910.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-sings-to-travis-kelce-with-adorable-lyric-change-and-his-reaction-is-adorable>Taylor Swift sings to Travis Kelce with ‘adorable’ lyric change – and his reaction is adorable</h2><p><a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> traveled all the way to Buenos Aires to support <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, and she definitely appreciated it, as told by her lyrics.</p><p>As it was time to sing her hit song, Karma, to Kelce’s, and fans’ surprise, she sang: “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me,” of course, referring to the Kansas City Chiefs player himself.</p><p>Of course, the Swifties went wild as they erupted into deafening cheers, but the NFL player’s reaction was the cutest of them all.</p><p>As the <a href=#>music</a> star’s father patted him on the shoulder, in a video, going viral on X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a>, the 34-year-old can be seen with a huge smile, holding his hands over his face. Probably, to hide his rosy red cheeks. Cute!</p><p>He then gets into the groove, vibing along with fans, and dancing with his hands in the air.</p><p>Of course, X has gone wild for the exchange, with some fans saying he was ‘husband material.’</p><p>“I love that he is ACTIVELY watching the show the whole time. He’s not on his phone, he’s not busy talking to someone else. His eyes are glued to Taylor and he immediately notices the lyric change. Like that’s husband material!,” exclaimed one.</p><p>“I’ve never seen any boyfriend win over Scott the way Travis has,” said another.</p><p>One joked: “Look at Travis blushing like a school girl.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-couple-share-a-kiss-at-the-end-of-the-show>The couple share a kiss at the end of the show</h2><p>If you thought it couldn’t get any more adorable, Tay can be seen running into her partner’s arms at the end of the night, giving him a huge kiss.</p><p>Although the couple has been seen out together several times, the only other time they’ve been seen kissing is when the Blank Space singer <a href=#>kissed him on the cheek</a> for a photo.</p><p>Of course, once again Swifties went absolutely wild for the interaction. Honestly, we don’t know how they coped with both of these in one night.</p><p>“the way she ran into his arms, you can tell she’s really in love,” gushed one.</p><p>Another penned: “She looks really happy, love that for her!”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2Z%2FcMDRmq2iq12gsq2vxKxkq52RmMGqu81mq6hlpJbGrbvRZqqwoZaperS1zaCgp59dqbxutMimZKygn6zAbrTErGShraOXrq%2BwjKaYrZ2inq6tew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
