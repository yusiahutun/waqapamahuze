That was in 2002, 2009 and 2015 — the three most appreciated football seasons in the Ferentz era.</p><p>Brian Ferentz unexpectedly met with the media ahead of the bowl, and had some insightful thoughts on how the “drive to 325” took attention away from the team.</p><p>“What I resent the most about this situation is that the focus has come off of our football players who have really accomplished some tremendous things this year,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Ferentz said</strong></a>.</p><p>Yes, Iowa lost to the No. 1 team in the country. Yes, the Hawkeyes still have the worst offense in the sport. Yes, this team’s won 10 games this year in ways only Iowa could — and they can still be in a class with two Orange Bowl teams, and a Rose Bowl runner-up.</p><p>On this subject, I stand with Brian. Let’s turn our attention back on this Iowa football team for one more game. Stop and smell the roses, you may not appreciate what you’re missing out on until it’s too late.</p><p>Prediction: 20-7 Iowa</p><p><strong>Ryan Jaster (10-3):</strong>&nbsp;You can’t spell Citrus <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>without UT</a></strong>. And Iowa once again gets <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the ol’ ball coach’s favorite punchline</a></strong> in the postseason.</p><p>Make no mistake: This is the Citrus Bowl. Slapping a Cheez-It in front of the name caused some confusion, but the former Cheez-It Bowl is now the Pop Tarts Bowl. And <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">what a debut it had</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>That Orlando bowl started in Miami as the Blockbuster Bowl in 1990 and has rotated through a variety of corporate names since. The first Cheez-It Bowl was played in Arizona in what was once the <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Copper Bowl</a></strong>.</p><p>Such is life in modern college football. More and more sponsors are getting <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their mayo’s worth</a></strong>, but the core bowl names should be retained no matter the sponsor.&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Holiday Bowl</a></strong> ditched <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the @holidaybowl handle</a></strong> for … <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>@directv_hb</a></strong> (?!) in deference to their new sponsor. That seems like a fumble worse than any of <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the three USC had</a></strong> against Iowa in <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the 2019 game</a></strong>, but I’m leaving <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>my tweet pinned</a> </strong>anyway.</p><p>The <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Orange Bowl</a></strong> was presented by <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FedEx</a></strong> when the Hawkeyes went <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">twice</a></strong>, but now Capital One is the title sponsor, which created this Citrus conundrum we have now. You see, the Citrus Bowl was known as the Capital One Bowl from 2003-2014, demoting the oranges, lemons, limes and, presumably, tangerines, since it was the Tangerine Bowl from 1947-1982. But who can forget <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that 2005 game</a></strong>? Same bowl.</p><p>But these Hawkeyes are playing in the Citrus Bowl, and it has a storied history beyond Steve Spurrier and sponsors, including <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the George L. Stuart trophy</a></strong> in its various forms. (Now <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">filled with crackers!</a></strong>)</p><p>The original trophy has <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a matching statue</a></strong> outside the stadium, and “is symbolic of the bowl’s charitable goal to benefit children’s hospitals.” That seems to be <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a good fit for the Hawkeyes</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Tennessee, historically, has not been a good match, at least in “recent” history. In football, Iowa won the first game and <strong><a href=#>lost the past two</a></strong>. In men’s basketball, the Hawks won the first two and <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>lost the past three</a></strong> — the last two in the NCAA Tournament in overtime. In women’s basketball, the Hawkeyes lost the first two and <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>won the last one</a></strong> — way back in 1993. So we found a positive before pivoting back to pigskin.</p><p>The <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>1982 Peach Bowl</a></strong> was the first time Iowa qualified to play in a postseason game that wasn’t the Rose Bowl. (1975 was the first year Big Ten teams <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>could go to a different bowl</a></strong>.) And they won 28-22.</p><p>They played again in 1987 in East Rutherford, New Jersey and the Hawkeyes lost 23-22 in what was known as the Kickoff Classic. Do we call <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the 7-3 win</a></strong> with no touchdowns that now? I digress.</p><p>The third and latest pairing was no charm. It’s not an exaggeration to say the Hawks were slayed in the <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2015 TaxSlayer Bowl</a></strong> in Jacksonville. <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People of the time period called it that.</a></strong></p><p>Now known as the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl, it was the last Iowa game that was not prognosticated by the <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Totally Irrelevant Prediction</a></strong>. It debuted <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>later that year</a></strong>. And while the poetry of ending it here abruptly — sandwiched between two Hawks-Vols games — was tempting, so was a nice, round number paired with one thin, vertical number – 10. The PS2’s got <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>one more year in it</a></strong>, even if a column filled with an <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>absurd</a></strong> amount of links and <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>obscure</a></strong> references doesn’t.</p><p>The TIP’s final outlook on Year 9 is <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>a messy 23-19 win</a></strong>. Seven field goals and 11 turnovers between the two teams. Hawkeyes wide receiver Ed Hinkel (he’s <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>in the game</a></strong>) has a key interception on a Tennessee fake punt. Iowa fumbles away a game-clinching touchdown at the 1, but ultimately comes out on top thanks to a dominant defense that — stop me if you’ve heard this before — bends but doesn’t break (unless you count a single garbage-time touchdown).</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hawkologist’s prognosis</a></strong> — after consulting with the words of <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>local reporters</a></strong> leaning Iowa and the <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>national media</a></strong> taking Tennessee — is a <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>3</a></strong> on the 6-point&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>pain</a></strong>&nbsp;index.&nbsp;These are ultimately and increasingly exhibitions, so let’s hope the Hawkeyes <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>have some fun</a></strong> on their vacation. Who knows, maybe they even score… -30-</p><p>Here’s a look at what others from near and far expect:</p><p><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>HawkeyeInsider.com</a></strong><br><strong>David Eickholt</strong>: Iowa 17, Tennessee 13.&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Click here</a></strong>&nbsp;to read more.<br><strong>Sean Bock: </strong>Iowa 14, Tennessee 13</p><p><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Go Iowa Awesome</a></strong><br><strong>Eliot Clough:</strong> Iowa 23, Tennessee 6</p><p><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>HawkeyesMic.com</a></strong><br><strong>Scott Dochterman: </strong>Iowa 20, Tennessee 16<br><strong>John Bohnenkamp:</strong> Iowa 17, Tennessee 7<br><strong>Marc Morehouse:</strong> Iowa 26, Tennessee 25<br><strong>Brendan Stiles:</strong> Iowa 17, Tennessee 13<br><strong>John Patchett:</strong> Iowa 17, Tennessee 10<br><strong>Tyler Tjelmeland:</strong> Iowa 16, Tennessee 10<br><strong>Jack Brandsgard:</strong> Tennessee 13, Iowa 10</p><p><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>CBS Sports</a></strong><br><strong>Dennis Dodd</strong>: Tennessee<br><strong>Tom Fornelli</strong>: Iowa<br><strong>Chip Patterson</strong>: Tennessee<br><strong>Barrett Sallee</strong>: Tennessee<br><strong>Shehan Jeyarajah</strong>: Tennessee<br><strong>David Cobb</strong>: Tennessee<br><strong>Jerry Palm</strong>: Tennessee</p><p><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>ESPN</a></strong><br><strong>Bill Connelly</strong>: Tennessee 22, Iowa 17</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Athlon Sports</a></strong><br><strong>Steven Lassan</strong>: Tennessee<br><strong>Joe Vitale</strong>: Tennessee<br><strong>Luke Easterling</strong>: Tennessee</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bleacher Report<br></a>David Kenyon:&nbsp;</strong>Tennessee 16, Iowa 13</p><p><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>USA Today<br></a>Scooby Axson:&nbsp;</strong>Tennessee<br><strong>Jace Evans</strong>: Iowa<br><strong>Paul Myerberg</strong>: Tennessee<br><strong>Erick Smith</strong>: Tennessee<br><strong>Eddie Timanus</strong>: Iowa<br><strong>Dan Wolken</strong>: Tennessee</p><p>For more Hawkeyes football coverage, follow&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#><strong>@BlakeHornTV</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#><strong>@HawkeyeHQ on Twitter</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#><strong>Facebook</strong></a>.&nbsp;You can find Hawkeye Headquarters at&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>HawkeyeHQ.com</a></strong>&nbsp;all season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/12/citrusbowl.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfqL2wvtOsZqGZp6CyurGMoZyanKGqrrPAxKuqaKCRrLi0ecSynGadqKWys8DSZqernZSesLV5yKiummWmqHq1sc2nnKyrlZp6qrqMnKCtqqWoeqO71qVm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
