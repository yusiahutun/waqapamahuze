But she didn’t give her fans an insight into her personal life. She tweeted about dating someone in 2009, but she preferred to keep the name a secret.</p><p>However, she made the name public almost a year later. Alec Shankman was the lucky recipient of the lovely journalist. Her boyfriend’s identity was revealed on Twitter on August 4, 2010.</p><p>The dating couple was so attracted to each other that fans of Larissa began to speculate that she might be her husband-prospect. Until 2013, the relationship drew public attention. Following that, they abruptly went low-key.</p><p>They did not marry or even get engaged, as many expected. She has no joint activities with her long-term boyfriend as of February 2020, according to her Instagram account.</p><p>Perhaps she had a secret wedding, tying the knot in a private setting.
