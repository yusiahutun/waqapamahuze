RIGGS' HEARTBREAKING OBITUARY &nbsp;</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font>Miss Sadie L. Riggs, 15, of Bedford, took her own life on Monday, June 19th, 2017.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sadie was born in Bedford on December 4, 2001. She is survived by her father, Eric Riggs and step mother Alicia Smith of Bedford and her biological mother, Beverly (Dodson) Riggs of Hopewell and by her motherly aunt, Sarah Smith, with whom she resided.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In addition to her parents, she is survived by Brother- Colby Wilson, California; Sister- Sheena Riggs, Defiance; Brother- Gaiege Dodson, Indiana, PA; Brother- Micah Riggs, Bedford; Sister- Rylee Riggs, Bedford; Brother- Dreygan Oberman, New Enterprise; Brother- Greyson Oberman, New Enterprise; Sister- Milaunna Dodson, Hopewell; Grandmother- Darlene Hall, Hopewell; Grandmother- Patricia J. Riggs, Bedford; Grandfather- Jeff Smith, Bedford; Grandmother- Stephanie Wallace, Bedford; Great Grandfather- Warren Feaster companion of Delores Materkowski, Bedford; Great Grandmother- Deanna Smith, Bedford; Great Grandmother- Ethel McDonald, Bedford. and Great Grandparents- Bill and Kay Dodson, Hopewell. Sadie is also survived by her special friends, Hannah, Karah, Jayla, TT, Mandy, Edie, Patrick & Greg and numerous aunts, uncles and cousins. She was preceded in death by Grandfather, Tony Dodson, Grandfather, Bob Wallace, Great Grandmother, Carole Feaster, Great Grandfather, Ted Smith and Uncle Travis Feaster.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sadie was a member of the Solid Rock Christian Fellowship Church in Bedford. She played softball and loved reading, drawing and music. Sadie was a sweet and loving girl and she will be greatly missed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A funeral service will be held at Louis Geisel Funeral Home, Bedford at 5:00 PM on Saturday, June 24th, 2017 with Pastor Wayne Mcgruder officiating.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Friends are invited to call on Saturday from 4:00 - 5:00 PM at the Geisel Funeral Home in Bedford.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In an effort to debunk the rumors about Sadie's death we would like to share this information. Yes, Sadie took her own life, she hung herself. It is hard to fathom that someone so young could be so troubled. Sadie was seeking help, she was in counselling and taking medication, but it was all too much for such a young soul to live with. If you take a minute and look at Sadie's family dynamics you will see that a large percent of the people in her life were not not related to her by blood but she was sent to us by God who knew this child needed a family. Sadie had a tough life and until a recent incident at school she handled everything life served her. For a young lady so excited about going to the High School things sure went terribly wrong for her. For the bullies involved, please know you were effective in making her feel worthless. That is all between you and God now, but please know that it is not to late to change your ways. Sadie's death has taken us to dark places, we will stick together and protect one another as we try to make sense of this tragic loss. To all the bullies out there, I just want you to know that as much as we despise your actions never, ever do we wish for you to feel the paralyzing pain that engulfs our bodies, a pain so severe that it makes the simple act of breathing difficult or the guilt that leaves us wondering what we could have done differently-or that struggle to remember the last words we spoke...Our hearts are beyond broken. Sadie, it was a privilege to have you in our lives and we will always love you. May you find peace in the arms of God and may we all be kind to one another.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In lieu of flowers, the family of Sadie ask that you be kind to one another.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKBd3%2BRcmprZ3%2BXtrXBwKuwZmllYsamrdFmpqWcXaC2rbjEnWSsnZybeqS1056qZquTnbywuIybrKWkmZrAb7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
