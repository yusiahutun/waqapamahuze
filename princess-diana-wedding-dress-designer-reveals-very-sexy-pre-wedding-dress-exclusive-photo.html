Instead of opting for a traditional bridal white gown, Diana turned to the masterminds behind her wedding dress, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Elizabeth Emanuel</a> and David Emanuel, for something with the "shock" factor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/28a79405ff50-diana-pink-pre-wedding-dress.jpg><p id=ewoZz5MMCGu data-wc=27>Ahead of what would have been Diana's wedding anniversary, Elizabeth opened up her photo archives and gave HELLO! an exclusive look inside her "very sexy" pre-wedding dress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ca195e86831c-elizabeth-emanuel.jpg><p id=eqGmkW1I0w2 data-wc=49>"Diana asked me to design a very sexy dress to shock everyone," Elizabeth explained. One unearthed photo revealed a mermaid-style gown with a figure-hugging silhouette, three-quarter-length sleeves and a low V-neck with a dramatic ruffle trim that ran down the bodice and into the skirt of the fuschia frock.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2009c6b53288-diana-elizabeth-david-emanuel-home.jpg><p id=eQ6tF4A8FQ8 data-wc=41>"The fabric was a rich silk taffeta in shocking pink – a sexy little number and one that was certain to attract attention!

The special details that remained largely hidden from the public were the small blue bow sewn into the waistband, which acted as her "something blue," and the horseshoe the designers stitched into the gown for good luck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a2c5588603a5-gettyimages-829898328.jpg><p id=eOCkhaeHhdA data-wc=62>"It was controversial and very new," Elizabeth told HELLO!. "There had never been a gown like that before. Mainly because we weren't given any constraints and we were out of college and we just loved designing and flamboyance and were all into lace and frills and ruffles, and it was the age of new romance.
