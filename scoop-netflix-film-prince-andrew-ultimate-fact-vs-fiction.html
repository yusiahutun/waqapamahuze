But how much of the film, which includes a disclaimer that “certain elements have been fictionalised for dramatic purposes,” is true? Here’s the ultimate fact vs fiction guide for watching the show…</p><h3>Jae Donnelly snapped the photos of Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Andrew in Central Park</h3><p id=e4An3dJX4g2 data-wc=1><strong>True</strong></p><p id=ecvDNj7joVV data-wc=82>The movie opened with photojournalist Jae Donnelly, played by Connor Swindells, going to some lengths (and getting very out of breath) to take the now-infamous shots of Prince Andrew taking a walk in Central Park with Jeffrey Epstein. Jae, who is still a photojournalist, did indeed take the snap which confirmed once and for all that the pair knew one another, and that Andrew had seen the convicted sex offender after he had spent 13 months in prison on child sex charges.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7563d6ea56b6-shutterstockeditorial4381006b.jpg><h3>Jae was in contact with Sam McAlister</h3><p id=eAJI4m2pXpj_ data-wc=1><strong>False</strong></p><p id=eqQ9cD6BmOsA data-wc=49>While in the movie, Jae is the one to help tip off Sam about the breaking news that Epstein had been arrested, leading her to be the first person at <a class=hm-link href=#>Andrew’s personal aide Amanda Thirsk’s door</a>, there is no evidence to suggest that this actually happened in real life.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9350ccb47166-sam-mcalister.jpg><h3>Andrew’s people reached out to Newsnight first</h3><p id=eSDavt5fDz1C data-wc=1><strong>True&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eD7JYulnYutz data-wc=48>Andrew’s team did initially reach out to Newsnight about a potential interview. However they were hoping that they would strictly discuss questions about Pitch@Palace, and the BBC show turned them down, telling them that they would need to be able to ask questions about Andrew’s relationship with Epstein.&nbsp;</p><p id=eU2nDN94KSpb data-wc=108>As Sam McAlister wrote in a piece for Radio Times: “It started, innocently enough, with an email in my inbox from a PR inviting us to do a ‘puff piece’ […] &nbsp;We declined that offer. We don’t do those at Newsnight. And then, a few months later, came an invitation to the Palace to meet Amanda… But there was a red line – no questions about Jeffrey Epstein. And so, even though at that stage (May 2019) it wasn’t the huge story that it became, we declined again. No interview.” It wasn’t until Epstein was arrested that Andrew’s team finally relented in allowing the interview to go ahead.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/72b1d8b290a1-gettyimages-1183220715.jpg><h3>The palace budgets extra for teaspoons</h3><p id=eg1M72wJIxnn data-wc=1><strong>Unverified&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e1nlK5G5CDDN data-wc=64>In a comment to Sam in the movie, Amanda jokes that the Palace has an extra budget for teaspoons, as guests tend to steal them as a memento that they have been there. She says: “They just seem to go. It’s seen as a good thing. It means everybody wants a part of us… The day we don’t need to budget for extra teaspoons…”&nbsp;</p><p id=eqeaGr1FMBcm data-wc=42>Although this sounds perfectly plausible, there isn’t any official word on the teaspoon budget situation at the Palace. Be warned though, if you ever step foot in the building, chances are the staff know what you’re planning to take home with you!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e30c09036b87-sitting-room-buckingham-palac.jpg><h3>Prince Andrew has a vast teddy bear collection</h3><p id=e0M0OwpB3OZu data-wc=1><strong>True&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ev5Os_UgA5 data-wc=45>In the film, Andrew loses his patience with a member of the house staff (incidentally <a class=hm-link href=#>played by Kate Winslet’s daughter Mia Threapleton</a>) over how she has arranged the teddy bears on his bed. If former testimonies are anything to go by, this is completely true.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ed761418f360-scoopunit05661rt.jpg><p id=eWxZiVORU6uK data-wc=80>Former royal protection officer Paul Page worked at Buckingham Palace from 1998 to 2004 and spoke about his love of teddy bears in the ITV documentary Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile back in 2022. He said: “There was a card in a drawer and it was a picture of these bears all in situ. The reason for the laminated picture was if those bears weren't put back in the right order by the maids, he would shout and scream."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Prince Andrew’s real-life obsession with teddy bears depicted in Scoop</figure><h3>The Queen combed Prince Andrew’s hair before he left for boarding school&nbsp;</h3><p id=eaKBQpuFmKPN data-wc=1><strong>False &nbsp;</strong></p><p id=evBy2RlR2Tnc data-wc=52>In the movie, Andrew reflects on his mother, telling his aide: “The morning I went away to boarding school… Mummy combed my hair. It was one of those tortoiseshell combs. Remember those? I can feel it now, scraping across my head. It hurt, but I… But I didn’t want it to stop.”&nbsp;</p><p id=eVVziV-BPg8o data-wc=34>While it’s certainly possible that the late Queen did have a hands-on approach to caring for her second youngest son, it appears that this particular recollection of Prince Andrew’s was invented for the film.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fa3e634eef00-gettyimages-142841735.jpg><h3>Andrew’s publicist quit over the planned interview</h3><p id=eYxuWBO0u6lt data-wc=1><strong>True</strong></p><p id=el5JlLK1DjT5 data-wc=44>PR guru Jason Stein did walk away from his role on Prince Andrew’s team after advising him not to speak on Newsnight, but it wasn’t quite as dramatic as the movie depicts. According to The Times, the decision to leave was “by mutual consent”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1f8cb096663e-scoopunit09281rt3.jpg><h3>Princess Beatrice joined Andrew to meet the Newsnight team</h3><p id=eHLmk18yXxDF data-wc=1><strong>True&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ez0EeJwhMWX8 data-wc=71>In the movie, Andrew brings along his daughter, Princess Beatrice, who is seen making notes at their meeting with the Newsnight team. According to Sam, this is completely true, as she told Tatler: “A meeting at the Palace on Monday 11 November (with Andrew, Emily, the deputy editor and a surprise guest, Princess Beatrice). A ‘yes’ finally came on Tuesday. A date was set for Thursday. A panic of preparation ensued.”</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Scoop star Sam McAlister reveals truth behind Amanda Thirsk losing job over Newsnight interview" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/787831cbb5f0-sam-mcalister.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Scoop star Sam McAlister reveals truth behind Amanda Thirsk losing job over Newsnight interview" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Scoop star Sam McAlister reveals truth behind Amanda Thirsk losing job over Newsnight interview</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Emily Maitlis finally addresses Scoop movie: 'I've left them very much to do their own thing'" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/1f3c1eb4c5ec-emily-maitlis-and-gillian-anderson-in-scoop.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Emily Maitlis finally addresses Scoop movie: 'I've left them very much to do their own thing'" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Emily Maitlis finally addresses Scoop movie: 'I've left them very much to do their own thing'</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Suri Cruise's temper tantrum makes an appearance in Netflix's Scoop - watch" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/9b0d56a2eaae-katie-holmes-daughter-suri-cruise.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Suri Cruise's temper tantrum makes an appearance in Netflix's Scoop - watch" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Suri Cruise's temper tantrum makes an appearance in Netflix's Scoop - watch</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eYcvqi8NMbTV data-wc=64>Emily also spoke about the awkward moment in the 2023 documentary, Andrew: The Problem Prince. She said: “[Princess Beatrice’s presence] was really quite a curve ball of curve balls. Can you imagine being in Buckingham Palace about to talk to a member of the royal family about sexual offences? That’s pretty tricky. And now I’ve got to do it in front of his daughter.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/21ffd2a76daf-prince-andrew-princess-beatrice.jpg><h3>Andrew also knew Jimmy Savile</h3><p id=eGhgW-KCyZii data-wc=4><strong>True (to an extent)&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eFk4YVMrQ52b data-wc=84>Prince Andrew had had dealings with Jimmy Savile in the past, namely featuring on Jim’ll Fix It in 1994 after hosting one of the contestants on the HMS Cottesmore. However, despite that, it appears that they had very few dealings, and that the line “I don’t know why everyone’s so upset about my friendship with Epstein – I knew Jimmy Savile so much better,” was written more as a joke, and perhaps to convey Andrew’s lack of understanding at the severity of the situation.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/af9b05afdbcd-gettyimages-135860236.jpg><h3>Andrew commented ‘Trousers<strong>!’ in</strong> regards to Emily Maitlis’ outfit</h3><p id=eXc6lIACd5qJ data-wc=1><strong>False&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eZRw-CxJEF data-wc=46>Sam McAlister told the press that she didn’t hear him make such a comment before the interview. However, Emily’s outfit was given plenty of consideration before the chat. Sam explained: “Like many women in journalism, every element of Emily’s appearance is pored over on social media.</p><p id=eL7IEoDrQftj data-wc=43>“It was definitely important we felt, sadly, that she wore something very conservative so we didn’t have an onslaught of criticism about her attire being inappropriate given the seriousness of the interview and the content. [That line] is the spirit of the situation.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a17f3c474545-scoopunit05213rt3.jpg><h3>Jeffrey Epstein went to Beatrice’s 18th birthday party</h3><p id=etyRDHK1mWMt data-wc=1><strong>True&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=edUbb_C7QROf data-wc=26>Yes, as mentioned in the show, Jeffrey Epstein did go to Beatrice’s Victorian-themed 18th birthday party and was photographed alongside Ghislaine Maxwell and Harvey Weinstein.

In reality, Emily previously revealed that Her Majesty realised that the interview would be a problem before Andrew did.&nbsp;</p><p id=emYv7O-RfF_x data-wc=72>Speaking in the Andrew: The Problem Prince, Emily explained: “It was only on the Saturday when the Queen had reportedly read the whole transcript that he received a tap on the shoulder by his security detail. And they said, I think, ‘Sir, you might have to come with us’. It was after the Queen had seen what the interview contained that I think it dawned on her before it dawned on him.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/de9d36d41012-the-queen-prince-andrew-ascot.jpg><h3>Andrew thought that the interview went well&nbsp;</h3><p id=eXDeDITaJcM1 data-wc=1><strong>True&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eZDfSuq487Dm data-wc=53>Prince Andrew was reportedly delighted by the interview, as was his team at the time. In her book, Sam wrote: “I could barely believe his people hadn’t stopped the interview. I would have, despite the consequences. ‘How did you think it went?’ I asked the equerry. She beamed. ‘Wasn’t he wonderful!’ she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=eu_p6TOAtacI data-wc=50>“I’d expected Amanda Thirsk to be distraught, the Prince to look shaken or concerned, but she was smiling, and he seemed ebullient. And then it hit me: he thought it had gone well. He was in such a good mood that he offered us all a tour of the palace.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/330c3916b1c9-scoop-netflix-andrew.jpg><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
