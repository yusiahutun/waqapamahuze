Let's read to find out.</p><h2>Lizzie Rovsek Marriage and Separation with Husband:</h2><p>The former model and fashion designer Lizzie, age 37, got married to Christian Rovsek on September 12, 2009, at Bacara Resort and Spa which is a luxurious hotel in Santa Barbara, California.&nbsp;</p><p>She welcomed a son named Preston (7) a year after tying the knot. Lizzie then gave birth to another son named Kingston who is now five-years-old.&nbsp;The cute boys are frequently seen in Lizzie’s social media posts. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While Preston and Kingston were frequently featured in Lizzie’s social media posts, she stopped sharing any photos with her husband which hinted their separation. &nbsp;However, Christian still has some pictures with Lizzie on Instagram.</p><p>On December 26, 2017, just a few weeks after another Real Housewives of Orange County star, <a href=# rel=follow>Shannon Beador</a>, filed for divorce from her husband of seventeen years, the news about Lizzie’s separation with her husband of eight years was revealed. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>According to Orange County Superior Court divorce documents obtained by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Radar</a>, Lizzie filed a petition for the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dissolution</a> of marriage against Christian on&nbsp;October 19, 2017, and the date of separation is cited as&nbsp;July 13, 2017.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She requested joint custody of their children while citing “irreconcilable differences” for the separation. And in lieu of appealing child and spousal support, she wrote,</p><p>“I anticipate all issues will be resolved through the mediation divorce process. If it is unsuccessful, I will seek leave to amend this petition to seek further relief.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Well, the 37-year-old Christian hasn’t yet responded to the filing, and there are no further hearings scheduled for the case. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Right after the news about Lizzie’s separation with her husband got revealed, she took Instagram to thank all those people who supported her knowing her heart and spirit.</p><p>The television personality, Lizzie is famous as the beauty pageant winner and television host.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Born on February 1, 1980, as Elizabeth Ann Arnold, Lizzie was able to win the title of 1998 Miss Kentucky Teen USA pageant and Miss Kentucky USA 2002.&nbsp;Meanwhile, she briefly dated <a href=# rel=follow>Nick Lachey</a>.</p><p>Lizzie, who has a degree in fashion design and merchandising from the University of Kentucky, has her own fashion business called 'Sun Kitten Swimwear.' Her brand specialises in high-end exotic designer swimsuits for women among which her signature swimsuits cost around $110.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, Lizzie's hard work and dedication have showered her with&nbsp;an amazing <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> of $25 million. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Lizzie's beautiful looks could be credited to her genes however she has not revealed her ethnicity yet. Further,&nbsp;while observing the pictures of Lizzie from Miss Kentucky Teen USA to RHOC, we can see many changes on her. It seems that she had undergone&nbsp;a plastic surgery as well.</p><p><img alt height=450 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/celebrity/Lizzie-Rovsek-surgery.jpg width=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Caption: Lizzie Rovsek before and after&nbsp;</strong><strong>nose job&nbsp;in pictures.</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Photo Credit: Liverampup</p><p>According to plastic surgeon Dr Anthony Youn, Lizzie might have <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">done</a> a nose job as her nose appears to be moderately thinned. Likewise, her lips also look visibly fuller which might be the result of a high-powered plumper. However, Lizzie hasn't opened up about the surgery.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqWhqq%2B2pnnRqK2snZtirqixjKGsrJqRo7FuvMuaqq2hk2LAtr7GnqmyZZ6awW7DzquroWWVqbWvtcKiq7Jlk522rbDRnqVnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
