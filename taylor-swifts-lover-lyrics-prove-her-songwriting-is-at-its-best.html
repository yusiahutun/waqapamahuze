It’s been less than a week since the pop star, 29, released her seventh studio album and it’s already earned the biggest sales this year in the United States.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Some might credit the success to the production, while others (like music exec <a href=#><strong>Scooter Braun</strong></a>) are <a href=#>shouting out the campaign</a> leading up to the much-awaited release. But, if you ask Us, it’s clear that the songwriting is what makes the music resonate with the Grammy-winning artist’s millions of fans.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Lover-Lyrics-That-Prove-Taylor-Swift-Songwriting-Is-Better-Than-Ever-01.jpg><p class=p1><strong><span class=s1>Keep scrolling for the best Lover lyrics in no particular order, according to Us!</span></strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>1. “And I scream, ‘For whatever it’s worth I love you, ain’t that the worst thing you ever heard?’” – “<b>Cruel Summer”</b></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>It’s impossible to not notice Swift’s increased level of self-awareness on this record, which makes sense since she is turning 30 this year. This lyric cuts deep due to the double-edged sword nature of falling in love.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>2. “My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue. All’s well that ends well to end up with you.” – “<b>Lover”</b></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>For years, her relationships have caused speculation from media and fans alike. But, now the singer is admitting that it’s all worth it if she spends forever with <a href=#>her current love</a>, <a href=#><strong>Joe Alwyn</strong></a>.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>3. “I’m so sick of running as fast as I can, wondering if I’d get there quicker if I was a man.” – “<b>The Man”</b></span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>“</span><span class=s1>A man does something, it’s ‘strategic’; a woman does the same thing, it’s ‘calculated,’” she recently told <a href=#>CBS News</a> while alluding to this feminist bop. “A man is allowed to ‘react’; a woman can only ‘over-react.'”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Lover-Lyrics-That-Prove-Taylor-Swift-Songwriting-Is-Better-Than-Ever-02.jpg><p class=p5><span class=s1>4. “I’ve been the archer. I’ve been the prey. Screaming, ‘Who could ever leave me darling … But who could stay?’” – “<b>The Archer”</b></span></p><p class=p5><span class=s1>In this song that was released before the album, Swift admits to having been both the hero and the villain in her life … something all too relatable for fans.</span></p><p class=p5><span class=s3>5. </span><span class=s1>“He got that boyish look that I like in a man. I am an architect, I’m drawing up the plans.” – “</span><span class=s3><b>I Think He Knows”</b></span></p><p class=p5><span class=s1>It’s impossible not to think of Alwyn’s boy-next-door charm when listening to this tune.</span></p><p class=p5><span class=s1>6. “I like shiny things, but I’d marry you with paper rings.” – “<b>Paper Rings”</b></span></p><p class=p5><span class=s1>The line that is sure to be spotted in Instagram captions for months to come speaks to the “ME!” singer’s realization that true love is worth more than any piece of jewelry.</span></p><p class=p5><span class=s1>7. “And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends. I’d never walk Cornelia Street again. That’s the kinda heartbreak time could never mend.” – “<b>Cornelia Street”</b></span></p><p class=p5><span class=s1>Here she gives a peak into her life for fans to theorize about. This one is clearly about the <a href=#>Greenwich Village apartment</a> she rents in NYC.</span></p><p class=p5><span class=s1>8. “I look through the windows of this love even though we boarded them up.” – “<b>Death By a Thousand Cuts”</b></span></p><p class=p5><span class=s1>The breakup track doesn’t pull punches when it comes to detailing how devastating the end of a relationship can be.</span></p><p class=p5><span class=s3>9. “</span><span class=s1>They say home is where the heart is. But God, I love the English.” – “<b>London Boy”</b></span></p><p class=p5><span class=s1>No surprise here since Swift’s The Favourite actor boyfriend is a Brit.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Lover-Lyrics-That-Prove-Taylor-Swift-Songwriting-Is-Better-Than-Ever-03.jpg><p class=p5><span class=s1>10. “And I hate to make this all about me, but who am I supposed to talk to? What am I supposed to do if there’s no you?” – “<b>Soon You’ll Get Better”</b></span></p><p class=p5><span class=s1>This collab with country group the Dixie Chicks cuts deep. Swift penned it in honor of her mom, Andrea, who is battling cancer.</span></p><p class=p5><span class=s1>11. “Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town. I’m New York City.” – “<b>False God”</b></span></p><p class=p5><span class=s1>Mic. Drop. The metaphor that Swift is NYC while seemingly being disregarded by a guy is such a clever lyric.</span></p><p class=p5><span class=s1>12. “You are somebody that I don’t know. But you’re taking shots at me like it’s Patrón. And I’m just like, ‘Damn! It’s 7 a.m.’” – “<b>You Need To Calm Down”</b></span></p><p class=p5><span class=s1>The LGTBTQ+ anthem is a seething takedown of haters from start to finish, but this line is particularly satisfying to hear the artist sing.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p5><span class=s1>13. “Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves. Chemistry ’til it blows up, ’til there’s no us.” – “<b>Afterglow”</b></span></p><p class=p5><span class=s1>This song takes an apologetic turn similar to her 2010 Speak Now track “Back to December.” But, the simple addition of the word “true” is a hint that Swift has found a love that will last.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdratdoby3sdFmo7KqmZjAbrzRqK2eZZiav26%2FzqeesKqZqbavs4yiqmaZpGK2tb%2BMm5ysrF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
