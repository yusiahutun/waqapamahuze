The lyrics celebrate individuality, success, and the ability to maintain personal style and flair even in the face of potential judgment. While the song may initially seem like a typical rap anthem focused on materialism and self-promotion, analyzing its standout lyrics reveals more depth and creativity.One of the standout lyrics in the song is "Dreads hang on designer everything, Mr. Comme des Gar√ßons, Mr. Alexander Wang." This line not only showcases 2 Chainz's love for high-end fashion but also serves as a metaphor for the collision of different worlds.

However, the younger individuals have now risen above their circumstances and achieved success. The theme explored here is the idea of resilience, taking ownership of one's destiny, and overcoming societal obstacles.The line "And she brainwash ya, head doctor" brings forth the theme of influence and manipulation.

It implies that 2 Chainz is not easily swayed or influenced by others, emphasizing his individuality and strength of character. The theme here is about maintaining personal agency in the face of external pressures or persuasive forces.Moving on to Lil Wayne's verse, he introduces themes of resilience, rebellion, and creativity.
