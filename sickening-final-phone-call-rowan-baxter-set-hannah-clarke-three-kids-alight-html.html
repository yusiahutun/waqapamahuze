Emotionally, physically, financially, our grief is still continuing.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>We have trouble articulating the emotional and mental impacts of this crime. They are so overwhelming it seems impossible to find the words.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Not one day has passed without tears, there is no rest, no escape, every single day we spend in the shadow of that moment of what was done to our beautiful angels. We would give anything to be free of those memories and constant thoughts.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In an instant I had taken from me every single female blood relative.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While of course I love all my boys, a mother and a grandmother needs her daughters and granddaughters to be complete. We will never again be complete.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The father and daughter bond is different but equally special and Lloyd has lost his only daughter.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Both of us have struggled with serious health issues, physical and mental.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>We have both spent innumerable hours with counselors and psychologists.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>We both have had to give up working.

She was regaining her sense of self and growing stronger.

I was just trying to find a program that you, that they offer for [unintelligible - "(ui)"].</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Yeah. Okay, what sort of program were you looking for?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Um, well I’ve been told just to try and look for a 10-week men’s behavioural change one.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Can I have your first name, please?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Rowan Bax-, yeah, so Rowan.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Rowan. And what’s your postcode, Rowan?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: 4152.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: 4152. And is that, um, let me see, now there’s four possibilities. Which…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Carindale in Brisbane is the suburb.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Carindale. Yeah, yeah, got you. Okay. One second. Um? Um, can I ask you how old you are?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: I’m 42.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Forty-two. Okay. Give me a sec, (ui)…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: That it’s not, it’s not my idea. Not my idea, but apparently I have to do it, so…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: It’s not your idea?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: At 42 I didn’t think I had to change, mate, but apparently I have to, because it’s going to help me out apparently, so…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Does that mean you’ve been dragged, you’ve been dragged squealing and kicking (ui)?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Well, I have. My wife, my ex-wife put a DVO on me to get my middle child back…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Right. Okay. Yeah, yeah.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: And, um, it’s a bit of, um, to be honest it’s a bit of, uh, it’s almost like a game to put her in a better position for Family Court. And unfortunately, um, I’ve been roped into it, and now this DVO, temporary one’s hanging over my head, uh…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Okay. We have to do something about it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Well, I just think it’s going to put me in a better position, he said, if I, you know because she, um, um, she’s trying to do, throw all sorts of things at me to breach it, and to do this and do that, and it’s just, it’s getting to the stage where, um, mate, I just about need to wear a spy cam on me 24/7…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Yeah.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: … because I just can’t trust her. Um, and unfortunately, um, I’m not really sure, um, the behavioural chan-, because I said to him, the lawyer, I said, does that, does that mean I’m guilty if I’ve got to do this?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: No. No.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: And he said, no.

No.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: No, that’s what I said. I said, mate, are you saying that I’m guilty if I accept to do this? And he said, no, no, no, it’s just to, um, put you in a, like just so, he did say the word, I can’t remember, just to, when we go through it all and they can say I’ve done this and done that. And, um, I sort of understand it, but I don’t, because I, um, I felt as though I’m not the one that has the problem, but I guess, um, I’m just doing what I’m told. So, um, but you might be able to explain it to me better.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Um, well normally men’s behavioural change programs are suited to people who may have anger issues, control issues. Doesn’t mean that that’s, you know, they’re physically violent or anything like that…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Yeah.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: … it just means that they’ve got things about them, and when they come to their partner in particular, that it doesn’t work out.

Yeah.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: And the whole program, there is no blame attached to you with this type of program.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Oh, that’s good. That’s good.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Oh yeah, yeah, it’s not, it’s not that you’re in there to get, you know to get beaten over the head with a stick or something, you know, metaphorically (ui).</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Yeah. Yeah.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: You’re there to look at your behaviour and to see is there any aspect of your behaviour is contributing to some of the arguments or some of the (ui).&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: On the DVO.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Yeah.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Well I, I…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: And that course, that that’s what it’s for (ui).</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: I think…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: And to come with ideas and strategies how you might do something different. Now that doesn’t mean to say your partner is blameless or that your partner…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>&nbsp;RB: Yeah. Yeah.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: … is not doing something. That’s a totally different issue. It’s what you…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Oh, mate…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Yeah. That’s what it’s about.

Yeah. So let me just see. Um, so you’ve given me your postcode 4152. Um, Carindale. Sorry, which State is that in, or Territory?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: It’s Queensland.

It makes me listen, your voice.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Yeah. What’s the nearest big city to Carindale?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: The city? Um, uh, Brisbane. Oh no, not the main city. Um, you’re not talking about Brisbane, you’re talking about inside, maybe Mt Gravatt.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: All right. Okay. Okay.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Mt Gravatt.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Were you brought up in Carindale? Is that where you’ve always lived there?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Mate, I’m brought up in Kiwi land.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Oh, really?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Yes. I’m a New Zealander.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: I wouldn’t have known. I wouldn’t have known.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Yeah. No, I’ve been here a little while now. I’ve been here since 2007.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Yeah, yeah. Right, 2007.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Mmm.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: So you were born and bred in New Zealand?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: I was. I moved over here when I was about, um, ooh, 28, something like that.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Right. Right.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Yeah. Yeah, maybe something like that, 28. Yeah. Yeah.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Yeah. Yeah. So about 15 years ago?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: No, no, 30, maybe 30, 30, 30, 1 years ago.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: So 12 years ago or so?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Approximately that, yeah.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Yeah. Yeah.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Thirteen…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: I’m not…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Yeah, coming up 13 years. Yeah.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Why did you, where were you born in New Zealand?&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Um, a place called Lower Hutt, which is in Wellington.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Oh, Wellington. Yes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Yeah. But I moved out of there and we moved up to a place called Tauranga.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Oh right. Okay.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB Um, Mount Maunganui. I was there for most of my life. And then…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Okay.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: … moved up to Auckland to play football for a little while, and then moved over here and, um, met a lovely lady at the time and had some children. And unfortunately it’s gone sour in the last three months and, um…&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Well hopefully you can get it back on track.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Oh, it’s definitely not getting it back on track, mate. I’ve been put through the wringer in the last two months. It’s unbelievable. Yeah. We ran a gym together. We had three, a CrossFit gym. We had three children, seven, oh six, four and three.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: And, um, yeah, one the guys we train with, she sort of had some feelings for him, and it started to blossom a wee bit behind my back. Yeah, she moved, she moved out at Christmas. Um, and I since found out that a month after that, that she had had feelings for this bloke, and she told him. And that’s where it started to get a bit messy.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Oh, right. Yeah, that’s right. Mmm.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: And then the kids, she started to hold the kids a little bit more, and I ended up, it got to the stage where, you know, I’m 42, I shouldn’t have to…&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Yeah.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: … ask for my kids. And then it got to the stage where that she was just dictating to me when I could have them. And she’s 30 so, uh, 32, so she’s only eight years younger, but she became very immature when it came to using the kids a wee bit, and then, um, we were at the park maybe Boxing Day, and my middle one wanted to come with me, and I said to her, well you can come with me then, and her mother didn’t want a bar of it. So, she still came with me, and her mother kicked up a stink. And then the next thing, you know, I get home to, um, I get home and some Police come and take her off me. She put a DVO on me. And then it’s just gone worse and worse and worse.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: It’s just gone from bad to worse.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Oh my God.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: So now, now if you do this, this is a step back in the right direction for you.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Oh my God. I can’t even tell you. So much of my life has been turned around in five minutes, it’s just scary.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: It is scary. Yeah. (ui) can change in a dime.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: And it is very, very, very, scary. Like and, um, I never, I never ever, ever thought my wife was capable of doing anything like this. So, but um, yeah.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: That’s what, well it is what it is at this stage.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Yeah. Yeah.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: So let’s, let’s see if we can get you back. Let me just check first of all. Because you’re from New Zealand, um, I take it that you’re not Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: No, I’m not. No, I’m, no, no, no.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Didn’t think so. Um, now there are two, let me just see, there are two men’s behavioural change courses…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: I rang up one, and they had a blinking 12-month waiting list.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Which one did you ring? Do you know?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Um, for the life of me, it might have been something to do with Anglicare.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Um, no, it wasn’t…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: And, and…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: … Anglicare that I was thinking of.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: It was, it was unbelievable. I’m like, but isn’t that telling them something if there’s a 12-month waiting list?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Well, it depends. Anglicare is probably the most popular. There are two other, there are two other places within 20 kilometres of that postcode. Now there’s one in Nudgee.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Yeah.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Now, um…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: And what’s the other one, do you know the other (ui)?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: And the other one is in Logan Central…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Okay.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: … maybe actually. Yeah, those are the two closest (ui).</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Logan would be closer to me I think.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Okay, Logan. I’ll give you, I’ll give you the names of both of them. So the one in Logan, Logan Central, that’s a Family Service place. Let me just check first of all do they do what you want to do? Yes, they do. They do anger management and behavioural change courses. They do. Um, the number for that is 07 3826 1500. That’s 0-…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: 1500.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Yeah, so it’s 07 3826 1500. And that’s in Kingston Road, Logan Central. But yeah, it doesn’t matter about the address, as long as you get the number to see what’s available. Now the other one is the Mercy Family Services, and that’s in Nudgee. Just in case the other one, I know the other one’s your first choice, but just to give you that one as well.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Yeah. Okay.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: That one’s 0-, and they do the men’s behavioural change course, so that’s 07 326-, sorry, let me start again, 07 3267 9000.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: 679? Sorry?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Triple zero. 000.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Perfect.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: So it’s 07 3267 9000.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: All right. Got that one. Fantastic.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Okay. And that’s at the Mercy Family Services. Now that’s within 20 kilometres. If I was to go out even further than that to 50 kilometres away, you actually get nothing. There’s nothing.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: All right.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: I would have to go further than that. If I go out a hundred kilometres then there’s only one other place.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Oh wow.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: So, and that’s, and that’s in, my goodness, I’ve never even heard of that place, that’s, um, Maroochydore. Maroochydore? Now that’s a way…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Oh, Maroochydore. Maroochydore.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Yeah, that’s Maroochydore.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Sunshine Coast, yeah.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Sunshine Coast? That’s beyond that again. So hopefully one of those two places that I’ve given you is, um…</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Yeah, I’d like to hope so.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Um, yes, I’d like to hope so as well. Um, listen if you don’t get anything, mate, first of all, ring those two places up, ask them is there something available, and if not, do you know of any other place? But let’s say you’re really stuck, and they don’t even give you another place, then come back to me and, or whoever picks up this phone, and just say, look, I’ve tried the two places, is there anything else you can help me with? I will see what else we can search for. But those are the two that come up obviously in my search, and I’ve got a great database, and I put in your postcode, and I put in what’s available within 20 kilometres and that’s (ui) what comes up.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Okay.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: So would you do that?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Sounds like a plan.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Yeah. Well, it’s a plan, Rowan. It’s a plan.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: I need, I need a plan.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: You need a plan.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: I do.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: First thing to do about your plan is give them a call.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Yeah, I will, mate.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: And let me check, I should have checked, sorry, I should have checked what times these places are open to. They’re probably closed now. Um, let me see. Um, it doesn’t actually say. That one doesn’t say. Let’s see if the other one says. Sometimes they don’t even tell you what time they’re open to. Oh right, the one in Logan is open until, um, 5:00 pm, so it’s closed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Okay.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Oh, sorry, it’s not, sorry, you’re in Queensland. What time is it there now?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Um, it’s 4:30.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Oh, right. It’s open till five o’clock.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Oh, well I might give them a buzz and hopefully (ui).</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Yeah, give them a buzz and see what happens. Give both of them a buzz, because probably both of them are five o’clock. Okay. I’ll let you go, Rowan.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Fantastic. Thanks for that.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: Give them a ring. No problem, Rowan.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: All right. Cheers. Thank you.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>KX: You take care. Cheers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>RB: Bye-bye.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2BcYKWaWxyaV%2BItqS3xKegp59dm7avrctmp6Gnnpp6pK3LpWSLp6eWu26OwLGrnqpdqLK1eaeapaeZmGKQra3RpJxmrJinsqZ5yqKbrGWRobaotNNnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
