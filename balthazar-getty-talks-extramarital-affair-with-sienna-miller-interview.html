"I don't see it anymore as something I need to run from, or prove to people that I'm not who they might perceive me to be. I've been able to own that and feel good about it."</p><p>When Getty turned the big 4-0, he decided it was finally time to change his lifestyle -- he quit smoking cigarettes and abusing drugs.</p><p>"It's no secret that my father and grandfather had major drug addiction problems, and addiction runs rampant in many families," the 41-year-old explains. "If you add wealth and celebrity on top of that, it can be lethal."</p><p>"A lot of people do drugs and alcohol to self-medicate," he says. "For me it was about the search for higher consciousness."</p><p>Though his famous moniker and inherited wealth does put added pressure on him as a person and as father, he says he tries to keep his four children grounded despite living a life of luxury.</p><p>"At least five days a week we have supper together," he says. "No TV, none of that. We sit and talk. Everybody shares about their day. And I play with them – sports, games, play songs, drawing, painting, whatever it is."</p><p>"I do have a very full, very blessed life, full of great people who allow me to be very comfortable, and for that I am very grateful," he adds. "So probably some of the clichés are true, but it doesn't define me."</p><p>What do you think about Getty's candid comments?
