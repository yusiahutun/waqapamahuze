But this year, the Oscars were awash with vintage, reworked and archival pieces, in a sign that pre-loved fashion really is becoming covetable – even in the upper echelons of Hollywood.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As part of its commitment to reducing its environmental impact and building a legacy of sustainability, this year, the Academy partnered with the global change-making organisation RCGD Global for the 2023 Oscars. The company, who we exclusively revealed had signed Zoe Saldaña as an ambassador alongside the American actresses Chloe East and Bailey Bass, produced a responsible style guide for the night.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'm committed to finding more ways to incorporate a sustainable presence within my fashion choices," Saldaña told us, ahead of her appearance on the Academy Awards red carpet. On the night, she sported a delicate Fendi gown, with vintage earrings and a ring from Cartier to complement her look.</p><img alt="95th annual academy awards arrivals" title="95th Annual Academy Awards - Arrivals" width=2433 height=3497 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/zoe-saldana-attends-the-95th-annual-academy-awards-on-march-news-photo-1678703348.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Mike Coppola</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Zoe Saldaña in Fendi and Cartier at the 2023 Oscars</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bailey Bass wore a Zac Posen custom couture gown, created using only four cuts of fabric, made from Tencel filament yarns derived from sustainably sourced wood. "It’s been an honour to dress Bailey Bass for her first Oscars in Collaboration with RCGD Global. It’s been very fulfilling to create a unique piece of art with true purpose,” said Posen.<br></p><img alt="hollywood, california march 12 bailey bass attends the 95th annual academy awards on march 12, 2023 in hollywood, california photo by kevin mazurgetty images" title="95th Annual Academy Awards - Arrivals" width=3401 height=5101 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1473110070-640ef1b2086bd.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kevin Mazur</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Bailey Bass in a Zac Posen gown</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Chloe East, meanwhile, wore a custom Monique Lhuillier dress, made from black Tencel and using reworked patterns and fabrics. A dramatic, elongated velvet bodice was reimagined from Lhuillier’s autumn/winter 2019 collection and paired with an architectural ball gown skirt.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I created a dramatic, sculptural, modern ball gown using a vintage piece from my collection," said Lhuillier.

Sustainability in the design world is such a multifaceted topic. For some it is about values – whether [they are] vegan or supporting artisans or women-led businesses; for others it is about efficiency, so [they are considering] cost per wear and investing in items meant to last. For others, the message doesn’t matter, the aesthetic does – so we focus on beautiful solutions. We try to find something for everyone.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It also encompasses more than just the tangible garments themselves, but also the world in which they are built – ensuring fair wages for garment workers, safe design processes and fair trade. Progress is being made towards more sustainable red carpets, but as long as sustainability is seen as all or nothing, we will have work to do."</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for The 10 best dressed at the 2023 Oscars" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/oscars1-640ee3f3c8881.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>What barriers do you think stand in the way of this?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"There are many barriers to contend with but I would say the biggest one is perception: the notion that design has to be sacrificed, that creativity has to be limited. Yes, red carpets are high-profile events that bring in international audiences, which can cause immense pressure [on all involved]. People want to look and feel their best, and there are entire teams involved. The point is, sustainability is not meant to be a barrier to creativity. It is an opportunity – which is why we focused on practical and accessible solutions and on pushing understanding further. Yes, it's about rewearing and wearing vintage, but it is also about spotlighting BIPOC designers and artisans, and challenging brands to step up. What people don’t say enough is how good it feels to be part of a more meaningful conversation."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Which designers do you think are making the most headway in sustainability at the moment?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Different designers are doing well for different reasons. House of Amma is wonderful at storytelling, sourcing locally and designing clothes to be heirlooms. Mother of Pearl is actively trying to be the most sustainable fashion brand it can be and having open conversations. Patrick McDowell is pushing for the use of sustainable materials like Tencel. They all share something in common: they see sustainability as a constant dialogue and are honest about the challenges they face as part of their journey.
