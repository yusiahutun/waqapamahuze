Specifically on the right shore near the northernmost Aurvangar Wetlands Boat Dock.</p><p>You’ll surely see it the moment you dock your boat. Here is what it looks like.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/god-of-war-ragnarok-aurvangar-wetlands-ormr-loot-lizard-1024x576.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=How_To_Kill_The_Aurvangar_Wetlands_Ormr_Lizard>How To Kill The Aurvangar Wetlands Ormr Lizard</span></h2><p>Now, after you find it, try to get close to it, and you’ll notice that it burrows in the sands; and you won’t be able to get too close.</p><p>If you try to hit the Ormr with your axe, you’ll notice that even Kratos is too slow.</p><p>But since the Lizard has to die, you’ll need to find another way to kill it. Since the Aurvangar Lizard is the first one you’ll encounter, you’ll hear Kratos teaching Atreus another lesson. Specifically, he’ll tell him that to kill the Ormr; he must hit it from behind.</p><p>And that’s what you need to do too. So, while facing the Aurvangar Wetlands Lizard, head right and jump on the wooden platform you see in the screenshot above.</p><p>From there, jump to the next one on the left, as you see in my screenshot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/god-of-war-ragnarok-aurvangar-wetlands-loot-lizard-how-to-kill-1024x576.jpg><p>From this spot, which you can see is behind the little critter, you can hit it without being spotted. Or, the Ormr won’t see the axe throw.</p><p>Once you kill it, head back to its location, and you’ll get the following items: Forged Iron, Shattered Rune, Rawhide, and Slag Deposits.</p><p>Great job, but keep in mind that other Ormr Lood Lizards are more difficult, so check our <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal rel=follow>God of War Ragnarok Wiki Hub here</a> for their locations and our in-depth guide for all <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal rel=follow>Aurvangar Wetlands collectibles here</a>.</p><p>Welcome back to ancient Scandinavia and to our God of War Ragnarök Wiki Hub, where we’ll tell you everything you need to know about one of the most anticipated video games of 2022.</p><p>Three years after the events of God of War 2018, we’ll embark on a new epic adventure as Kratos and Atreus, who will now face new threats and new enemies.</p><p>During this adventure, we’ll explore Midgard, Svartalfheim, Alfheim, Helheim, and Niflheim, which are filled with collectibles and puzzles.</p><p>Our God of War Ragnarok Wiki covers the locations of all collectibles in the latest video game developed by Santa Monica Studio for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.</p><p>Starting with the locations of all Books required for The Librarian trophy, followed by the Artifacts you’ll need to find to unlock The Curator trophy; everything is covered by the guides below.</p><p>Additionally, we’ll tell you where to find all Apples of Idunn, Horns of Blood Mead, Shields, Relics, Sword Hilts, and Crater Hunts.</p><p>Last but not least, we’ll go over the trickiest puzzles and favors (side-quests) you’ll need to complete so that you can put an end to the upcoming Ragnarök.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qK3MnpqlrZKve6S7zGieqJxdpLNuw8CrZKuZl6Ous7vKZpiuqqaWu6it0Waunqyclrulv4yoqaaqXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
