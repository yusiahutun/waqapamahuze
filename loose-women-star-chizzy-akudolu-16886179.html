It’s being dealt with. It’s going to be a long, long journey.</p><p>“I’ve been speaking to people who have been on this journey for 20 years, so I know it’s not a quick fix.</p><p>"That’s what a gastric band would be. But I don’t want to do that. “To do this properly there’s a lot to sort out in my head.</p><p>“When I can get to grips with what’s up there, the body will follow. And I’m now getting to a better place because of a lot of help.”</p><p>Chizzy appeared to be bursting with confidence when she performed on Strictly last year.</p><p>Its 10million viewers had no idea that she was secretly battling addiction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article15144757.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Chizzy-Akudolu-1427676><p>She said: “The problem is you can’t get away from food. It’s always there. And there is shame attached to food addiction.</p><p>“The toughest point for me was when I had depression because of it. When you have a mental health issue, it’s nothing to be ashamed of and it’s not something you ask for.</p><p>“But that doesn’t make it easy to deal with.</p><p>“Mental health issues affect quite a lot of people. I think people should talk about it and then maybe less people will commit suicide.”</p><p>Chizzy spoke out about her struggle on Loose Women and has been overwhelmed by the viewers’ response.</p><p>She said: “I didn’t plan to talk about so much personal stuff so soon after joining. But there’s something quite cathartic about doing it. When you release stuff, any shame you have is released with it.</p><p>“I’ve had people tell me they have had anxiety and depression. And I’ve had people say they have weight issues like me.</p><p>“I know I’m not alone now. And I feel like I’m in a good place.”</p><p>In recent months Chizzy has become a regular on Loose Women. The show is more than just a telly job for her.</p><p>She said: “The other women are such a great bunch. They’re really caring.</p><p>“I’m really lucky to be on a show where I can rely on people. The show is like a counselling session because a lot of the other women have been on it for years. “While they’re not qualified counsellors, they know what they’re talking about.”</p><p>Chizzy’s acting career is also on a high after it was announced she is returning to Holby City as surgeon Mo Effanga.</p><p>Fans will see her back on the BBC medical drama this Christmas.</p><p>Chizzy said: “I’m really honoured to go back in. I love the show and going back was so like coming home.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdloo6ino5p6uLvMnqVmq6SWv26vx6Kxs7Fdlri2sM6lrGZpZm2Fd32Wcg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
