In court documents obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a>, Holker filed a a California Spousal Property Petition in the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles County, which is standard procedure when spouses die without a will. According to People, though California law states that a surviving spouse is entitled to half of their deceased spouse’s joint estate once they’re dead, the living spouse still has to file the petition to prove they are actually the spouse of the person who died. Holker asked for “determination of property passing to the surviving spouse” as well as “confirmation of property belonging to the surviving spouse.” The court documents detailed property, including quasi-community property, that Holker asked the court to rule she will receive as tWitch’s surviving spouse.&nbsp;“This includes any interest in a trade or business name of any unincorporated business or an interest in any unincorporated business that the deceased partner was operating or managing at the time of death,” court documents state.</p><p>Holker did not request for administration over tWitch’s estate. In the court documents, Holker alsoreported that tWitch had a “nil” net worth and that he didn’t receive any property through a gift, joint tenancy, life insurance or other beneficiaries after they married on December 10, 2023. The court documents also confirmed that tWitch lived in California throughout his whole marriage to Holker and that they didn’t have any written agreements between them on how their properties would be divided if one of them died. Along with half of their joint estate, Holker also requested half of tWitch’s Stephen Boss Productions company and Goldman Sachs investment account, as well as his royalties from Cast and Crew Production Services; Disney Worldwide Services, Inc.; GEP Talent Services, LLC; and SAG/AFTRA, according to the court documents. The court documents confirm tWitch died intestate or without a will.</p><h2>How much did tWitch make on So You Think You Can Dance?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Stephen-Twitch-Boss-3.jpg><p>How much did tWitch make on So You Think You Can Dance? tWitch was a contestant on So You Think You Can Dance season 4, where he was the runner-up.

Meanwhile, I had blond hair and piercings, so I’m not sure how you’d forget me, but that’s neither here nor there,” tWitch told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Dance Spirit</a> in 2012.</p><p>Holker and tWitch, who was the runner-up on So You Think You Can Dance season 4, reconnected in 2010 when they were both all-stars on SYTYCD season 7. “<span>We met again during Season 7, but didn’t say a word to each other the whole season. So that’s why I had no idea, because she wouldn’t talk to me and I thought she wasn’t interested. She did catch me checking her out in the hallway once,” tWitch said. Holker, however, denied that she didn’t make a move on tWitch. “I didn’t just make one move—I made, like, 10 moves and he wasn’t seeing them, so I had to put myself out there even more. From the first week of So You Think You Can Dance as all-stars, I thought he was the cutest guy ever. His personality was so fun,” he said.</span></p><p>Their relationship didn’t turn romantic until August 2010 when they attended the premiere of Step-Up 3D, which tWitch starred in, in Los Angeles, and tWitch asked for Holker’s phone number.&nbsp;“The all-stars went to the Step Up 3D premiere, but Stephen went separately because he was in the movie. I looked down the red carpet and saw him standing there in this nice gray suit and glasses—he looked so hot,” Holker said. “When he walked up to say hi, I got embarrassed and hid behind Ade! Then, at the party, I met his mother and brother and even danced with him a little bit. I was geeking out. That was the first night we were out together at the same place. So I finally made my move, and he asked for my number.”</p><p>Though they exchanged numbers, it wasn’t until the So You Think You Can Dance wrap party that either made a move on the other. “I was nervous! So, anyway, when the season 7 wrap party came, I knew it was the last night I would see him. I was like, ‘Geez, I guess I have to be stronger about my moves.'” Holker said. “I hadn’t planned on going because I’m a mom and don’t really go out and party. But when he texted to see if I was going, I was ready and in the car! I showed up and people were trying to say hi, but I was on a mission to find this guy. I saw him at the other end of the room, and he pointed and did this little ‘come here’ motion. We went upstairs and danced for three hours straight.”</p><p>The two got got engaged in 2013 when tWitch proposed to Holker while filming a commercial. They married that December at So You Think You Can Dance judge and creator Nigel Lythgoe winery in Paso Robles, California. Their first child together, son Maddox, was born on 2016.&nbsp;Holker and tWitch share two children: son Maddox, 6, and daughter Zaia, 3. tWitch was also the stepfather to Holker’s daughter, Weslie Fowler, from a previous relationship.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in February 2022, Holker revealed that she told tWitch he was The One three weeks into dating. “Three weeks into us dating, I told him that he was my one,” she said. “I was so confident.” tWitch, however, didn’t know Holker was The One until three months after their first dance at the So You Think You Can Dance season 7 wrap party when the two were on a date and came across a house that was being remodeled and decide to have a look around. “We hopped the fence, we found the door that’s open and the alarm goes off,” he said. “I turned to look and Allison’s already running and as I’m sprinting to catch up with her, I know it’s the weirdest thought, but I’m like, ‘Yo, I’m going to marry this woman.’ That just let me know she’s the one.”</p><p>Holker told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">OK magazine</a> in October 2022, two months before tWitch’s death, that she and her husband were still in their “honeymoon phase.” “We already spent so much time together, but now we wake up, we go to our office together, we work together all day. I know a lot of people probably think that sounds crazy, but we love it. We’re together all day every day and we are just living our best married life. I feel like we’re back in the honeymoon phase again!” she said at the time.</p><p>She continued, “People around us are like, ‘Oh my gosh, you guys are still in that lovey phase.’ We haven’t gotten out of it all! He inspires me every single day, and I think we share such a mutual respect for each other. I respect him as a man, a father, and he does the same for me. I feel like there’s a lot of appreciation and respect, and I think that’s what really helps us is that we stay engaged with each other. There’s not a day that goes by that either one of us do something for each other and we don’t say thank you for going the extra mile. We explore that in our relationship a lot. I make it really, really important.”</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health crisis, help is available.
