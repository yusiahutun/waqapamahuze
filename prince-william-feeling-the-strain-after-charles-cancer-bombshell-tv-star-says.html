But Buckingham Palace has not clarified what type or the prognosis. <a href=#>King Charles</a> recently received treatment for an enlarged prostate last month, with The Firm confirming he has not been diagnosed with prostate cancer. However, he has already started treatment at home as an outpatient. <a href=#>Royal</a> commentators discussing the bombshell health news has said the man next in line to the throne will be feeling the ‘pressure’. In particular, they speak of <a href=#>Prince William</a>, who will be coming back to duty for Charles after the cancer news.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-william-will-feel-that-pressure-to-get-back-into-public-life-after-charles-cancer-news>Prince William will feel that ‘pressure to get back into public life’ after Charles’ cancer news</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-992037612-1024x683.jpg><p>Piers Morgan spoke about the health news <a href=# rel=nofollow>on</a> TalkTV last night. Talking with broadcaster Andrew Neil, he said the bombshell news points to the ‘fragility’ of The Firm.</p><p>Andrew said: “It comes at a bad time. Cancer diagnosis never comes at a good time. For the royal family, we’ve gone from surplus to famine very, very quickly.”</p><p>He was referring to Harry and <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> stepping down as senior members for the palace. They later moved across the Atlantic to their <a href=#>Montecito mansion</a>. On top of this, Prince Andrew, Charles’ brother, is now a non-working member too. It also comes after Kate is out of action for two more months.</p><p>He added: “Our royal family is pretty short-handed, this will put a huge strain on the Queen. It’s a very difficult time for her. Also, more strain for William, who was hoping to step back to look after his wife, he is now under pressure and will succumb to that pressure to get back into public life and pick up some of these engagements.</p><p>“The productivity of the remaining senior members of the royal family who are able to do what royals should be doing, not many of them anymore, that will have to increase in the weeks and months ahead.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-crisis-time-for-the-royal-family>‘Crisis’ time for the royal family</h2><p>Tom Bower, royal author, chimed in: “It does come as a shock. On the other hand, before Christmas, an enabler in High Grove said that the King wasn’t well.”</p><p>The monarch announced at the beginning of the year, via the palace, he was set to <a href=#>undergo surgery for an enlarged prostate</a>. Charles received treatment at the London Clinic and stayed for three nights, with <a href=#>Queen Consort Camilla ‘breaking royal protocol’</a> to visit him.</p><p>When he left the hospital, he waved to crowds with a smile. He was also seen in good spirits on Sunday, February 4, following a church service.</p><p>The sources who allegedly spoke to Bower were likely speaking about his planned procedure.</p><p>Broadcaster Andrew Neil told Morgan this was a “crisis” moment for The Firm, following <a href=#>Kate Middleton’s stay in hospital</a>, too. On the same day, the palace announced <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> would be undergoing abdominal surgery. Again, the palace did not say what procedure or any other details. She was in hospital for two weeks before it’s believed she left <a href=#>via the ‘back door’ to go home</a> to her family.</p><p>The Princess of Wales will be out of action for a few months, not returning until Easter.</p><p>It’s believed to be a tough time for the monarchy because Charles and Kate not being able to perform royal duties. <a href=#>Queen Camilla</a> had been seen at an event in the absence of the King while he was in hospital. Whereas, William was taking time out to look after his wife. Therefore, there are fewer royals around to step in.</p><p>The Sunday Times editor Roya Nikkah said The Firm will want to minimize <a href=#>health</a> risks as His Majesty will conduct business remotely while receiving treatment as an outpatient. The Counsellors of State, who are appointed to step in when needed if a monarch is unable to fulfil duties, have not been acted upon. Charles is expected to continue as normal, including Privy Council meetings and meeting the Prime Minister, from his residence.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-families-come-together-in-dramatic-events>Families come together in ‘dramatic events’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1387844723-1024x740.jpg><p>The reported family feud within The Firm hasn’t been brushed under the carpet over the past few years. The 39-year-old Duke of Sussex wrote about altercations and arguments with William and Charles in his memoir Spare.</p><p>But commentators believe there is concern Harry would write about more private conversations in future books.</p><p>Tom Bower said on <a href=#>Harry flying back to the UK for Charles</a>: “I am very suspicious, as we discussed, Harry’s agenda has been so anti-monarchist as being so disrespectful of the King and the Queen and of course his brother.</p><p>“For him to suddenly to turn up in London, not having expressed any concern for his father when he heard originally about the prostate problem which was two weeks ago, that has been a pillar of silence.</p><p>“I think it shows how serious it is”.</p><p>However, sources close to the Sussex camp told news outlets both Harry and Meghan called the King after hearing about his health. Reports say they reached out to both royals in the wake of their health news. Therefore, the dad-of-two had shown concern for his father initially. It also comes after the couple apparently had a personal call with the monarch for his 75th birthday last year.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2WDcLzRoqWcnV2stq24yJqkZp6VmrmqusZmq6GdXajBs63Ip2SanqSav26vx5qppZ2jYrCiusKeqWaan6KvtLTEpaNmrKZiwLWt0WaqmrGjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
