However, the payment is not the same for all teams, and some pay contract-based salaries to the staff.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e5ab8e8ec6c41ce1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>UFC ring announcer salary: How much do they make in 2021?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Several netizens have also been asking, "Is F1 pit crew a full-time job?"

Only the crew chief has a fixed role, but all the others can change on a need basis. So, how much do pit stop crew get paid?</p><h3>1. Pit crew chief</h3><p class=align-left>The chief is the crew boss or the person in charge of all the members. He or she selects his team members and coordinates all the pit stop activities. For example, a Formula One crew chief determines which tyres go on the car and decides on the best <a id=https://www.thefocus.news/sports/motorsport/f1/how-much-does-an-f1-pit-crew-make/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">strategy</a> for the team.</p><p class=align-left>Because of his crucial role, the team leader is the best-paid member of an F1 pit crew, earning approximately $10,000 per race and $1 million annually.

Tyre changers</h3><p class=align-left>Pit crews have a four-member tyre changing team, each responsible for changing one tyre.

In addition, their race-winning bonus is $2,500.</p><h3>3. Tyre carriers</h3><p class=align-left>Each team has two carriers assigned to each wheel to replace the old tyres with new ones. One of them takes off the wheel while the other one attaches the fresh one. The eight-member team has to be fast to get the wheel to the <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/313949-10-expensive-cars-kenya.html href=#>vehicle</a> in the shortest time possible.</p><p class=align-left>The salary for a tyre carrier is approximately $3,500 per race and an annual salary of $270,000. Carriers also earn an extra $2,500 as a race-winning bonus.</p><h3>4. Jackmen</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e5ab8e8ec6c41ce1.jpg><p class=align-left>Two jackmen lift the car at the back and front using a lever for the pitstop procedure.

Fire extinguisher man</h3><p class=align-left>This individual stays on standby to put out a fire in case such an incident occurs. They earn approximately $500 per race and $30,000 per year.

Refuellers earned approximately $5,000 per race and $350,000 annually. In addition, their race-winning bonus was $2,500.</p><h2>How to become an F1 pit crew</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5f5ef85b9e2c7120.jpg><p class=align-left>Several netizens and speed lovers have been wondering what it takes to become a Formula One pit crew member.
