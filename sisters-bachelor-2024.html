In a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a>, former host Chris Harrison revealed that Bachelor Nation couples have to stay together for a certain amount of time, otherwise they have to return the free engagement ring to Neil Lane. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some rule, after a certain number of years, you get to keep it anyway,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut after months‚Ä¶ it goes back.‚Äù</p><p>Lane told <a href=#>StyleCaster</a> in 2016 that he doesn‚Äôt know where the rings go, but that he designs them with the hope that the couple stays together. ‚ÄúI make rings hoping that people stay together forever, but after they get the ring, I don‚Äôt have a say in it, and what happens after that, I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhere the ring goes, I have to say, I don‚Äôt really know. I just say it goes to ring heaven.‚Äù</p><p>So who is The Bachelor 2024 winner, Daisy Kent? Daisy is a 25-year-old Account Executive from Becker, Minnesota, who now lives in San Diego, California.
