Robicheaux, 42, was charged with assaulting five women, Riley, 36, with assaulting three.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Robicheaux, a hand doctor, was previously best known for his appearances on the reality show Online Dating Rituals of the American Male.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Orange County Superior Court Judge Michael Leversen ruled on Friday the accusers were 'incompetent' and referenced 'various differing statements through the years' when telling the couple that the case would not go to trial.
