The practice is called gua sha, and the objects are tools made of stones like jade and rose quartz. While most of the "trends" that live on TikTok have shorter life cycles than that of a fruit fly, the Chinese practice has already been around for thousands of years — some people are simply just getting the memo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Gua sha literally means ‘to scrape sand’ in Mandarin,” Lin Chen, the founder of Pink Moon, tells InStyle. And although the blitz of TikTok videos landing on your For You Page might have you believe the practice is just for facial sculpting, "its healing capabilities extend far deeper," Chen says. Don't let the word "scrape" scare you off, though. The slow strokes won't actually tear or bruise the skin, and Chen confirms that gua sha is not only safe but "amazing for sensitive skin." That's why many use it as a form of self-care today.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As with many wellness practices that have become mainstream, there is an influx of brands creating gua sha stones — that’s why it was important for us to feature products from AAPI-brands who have a rich history and connection to the art of gua sha. After conducting research and consulting with experts, we found the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Yina Bian Stone Gua Sha</a> stellar for addressing numerous skin concerns and reaching small and big areas alike.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you’re a gua sha newbie or have been incorporating the practice into your routine for years, find our favorite AAPI-owned gua sha tools below.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-yina-bian-stone-gua-sha></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Yina Bian Stone Gua Sha</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Yina Bian Stone Gua Sha" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Wlh1_P9JaX2E7b25XDQiDBDnYls=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/yina-bian-stone-gua-sha-128b545504cd4a499103108f984f2dc5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Yina</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While you may be used to seeing pastel-colored gua sha tools made from rose quartz or jade, cosmic bian crystals have also commonly been used for centuries. This tool from Yina is cut from the Bian Shi stone which contains over 30 minerals and trace elements that are known to help regenerate cells and draw out negative energy.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The uniquely shaped tool features both smooth and rigid sides that are designed to increase circulation, depuff, smooth fascia, and tone the skin. We love that it’s large enough to swipe across the body, yet still small enough to comfortably reach smaller areas like your temples and jawline. And if you’re unsure of how to use the stone, don’t fret: It comes with a clear guide with illustrated diagrams to show you what sides of the stone are best for each area of your body.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Shoppers can’t seem to get enough of this tool, either — it has only accrued five-star reviews; most of which rave about the size and results: Many say that with consistent use they have felt a significant decrease in tension, especially in their shoulders and jaw. Try warming the tool up under warm water and using it on your neck and shoulders to loosen things up.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>​​Stone Type: </strong>Bian<strong> | Best for:&nbsp;</strong>Face and Body</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-stainless-steel-sacheu-beauty-stainless-steel-gua-sha></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Stainless Steel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sacheu Beauty Gua Sha</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fI-lrhtGabk7XMAO07VlBeQuQjY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sacheu-stainless-steel-gua-sha-ca38cdfa1c8e464abf842957f66262cf.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Instantly wake up and refresh dull, sleepy skin with the Sacheu Stainless Steel Gua Sha. Naturally cold, this stainless steel skin care tool instantly depuffs swollen, inflamed complexions — so you don’t need to put it in the fridge to reap the cooling benefits. Acting as a full-body lymphatic drainage tool, each side serves a different purpose: The wider curve eases tension along your neck, decolletage, arms or legs; the divot side is designed to glide along your jawline and cheekbones to sculpt; and the flat offers relief along the temples.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love that stainless steel is inherently anti-bacterial, so the tool won’t harbor any bacteria or product buildup since it isn’t porous. It’s also extremely easy to clean: You only need to rinse it with warm water. Be sure to use this alongside a serum or cream, because on its own it can cause tension.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>​​Material: </strong>Stainless Steel<strong> | Best for: </strong>Face and Body</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-comb-edge-supernal-cosmic-stone-nephrite-jade-gua-sha-tool></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Comb Edge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Supernal Jade Gua Sha</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Supernal Cosmic Stone - Nephrite Jade Gua Sha Tool" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/QstCBYkXNjKjSdCg4cHLRtng-wo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/supernal-cosmic-stone-nephrite-jade-gua-sha-tool-a330c2be89b64f259e570c4f0797c29e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Supernal</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like the name suggests, the Supernal Cosmic Stone gua sha is out of this world. Featuring four unique sides, the Cosmic Stone has all your skin needs covered. The wider waved edge is great for longer sweeps across your face, neck, and body to detox and calm. Similarly, the wavelet edge — a slightly smaller curve — perfectly hugs your cheeks and forehead. Swiping upwards with this side is great for preventing fine lines and wrinkles. The comb edge (our personal favorite) helps improve blood circulation and collagen production, a feature often not found on gua shas. The fine teeth make it ideal to sculpt your cheekbones and target fine lines on the neck. It can also be used on your hairline to stimulate hair growth. Lastly, the deeper arch works to mold your face, improving your skin’s firmness and giving the appearance of a lifted look.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Simply put, this tool simplifies your routine, combining four tools into one. Just be sure to regularly clean it as the nephrite jade is very porous and tends to absorb skin care products.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>​​Stone Type: </strong>Nephrite Jade <strong>| Best for: </strong>Face</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-rose-quartz-pink-moon-rose-quartz-gua-sha-facial-tool></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Rose Quartz</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pink Moon Gua Sha Facial Tool</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5NO93Y04l7gkPW6vOQn8FDnPvUA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pink-moon-rose-quartz-facial-gua-sha-tool-c42b9d3e32b74f63b8d6686888876d43.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Indulge in a little self-care with this heart-shaped gua sha tool from Pink Moon. Rose quartz — symbolically known as being the crystal of self love and protection — is a great stone for those with sensitive skin because it naturally calms inflammation. Made specially to fit within the contours of your face, it can be used in a variety of ways: Glide the curved side along your cheeks and jawline to drain your skin of any excess water. Then, swipe the edged side to sculpt and lift your features.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This beloved tool comes complete with a velvet pouch for safe storage.

Made with jade, a balancing stone known for its naturally cooling properties, this smooth stone sculpts and shapes facial features with minimal pressure. Featuring three different sides, this versatile tool is great for those looking to target their cheekbones and jawline. Using the indented side, cup the gua sha around your cheekbone or jaw and glide upward to accentuate your natural features. No need for fillers with this tool, as over time your skin will appear firm and lifted, and who doesn’t want that? We recommend visiting Mount Lai’s Instagram page to discover new ways to utilize your tool, as they regularly post new tutorials. Reminder: Gua sha tools are delicate — especially this one — so be sure to handle it gingerly and store it in a pouch to ensure it doesn’t break.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Stone Type: </strong>Jade, Rose Quartz, Amethyst, or Black Obsidian | <strong>Best for: </strong>Face</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-beginners-lanshin-intro-gua-sha-tool-nephrite></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Beginners</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lanshin Intro Gua Sha Tool</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lanshin Intro Gua Sha Tool Nephrite" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ycgBVcLI8RXS7yfnztsXZKu0mmE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/LanshinIntroGuaShaToolNephrite-ccb6c72942804b09bfdffe20b5857249.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lanshin</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re new to the art of gua sha and don’t know where to start, the Lanshin Intro Gua Sha Tool will make you wonder why you waited so long to incorporate this wellness practice into your routine. This beginners facial tool is made of He Tian jade, a dark green stone with healing properties. When swiped along facial contours, it helps release tight muscles, defines your facial structure, and creates a smoother and brighter appearance. To begin, apply a facial oil or serum of your choice to avoid any harsh pulling of the skin. Then, using one of the four curved edges, place the tool flat on your skin and apply medium pressure while dragging upward. Be sure to hold your skin taught, so that you don’t create unnecessary tension. If you’re unsure of where to swipe, Lanshin has a full tutorial page for all levels to maximize the benefits of your practice, too. Beginners should be sure this is the tool they want to use, though, as all of Lanshin’s gua sha tools are final sale.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>​​Stone Type: </strong>Jade |<strong> Best for: </strong>Face</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Stone Type<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Gua shas are most commonly made from jade, rose quartz, bian, or amethyst stones.

If you struggle with inflammation, use a jade tool, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Mount Lai Gua Sha Facial Lifting Tool</a>, to help with lymphatic drainage.

When it comes to finding the right sized tool for you, you want to take a look at your skin’s needs. If you’re looking to relieve any tension you hold in your skin, opt for a tool that features sharper, rugged edges as they knead out any tension you’re holding onto.

For example, if you plan on using your gua sha on your legs or stomach, you’ll want a larger tool to cover more surface area.

Collagen helps to reduce wrinkles and elastin helps to firm and tone the face. This increased circulation always increases detox for a clearer complexion.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you use a gua sha tool?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As with most practices, there are many techniques when it comes to gua sha – and they all target different needs.

Then, apply light pressure as you swipe. “A gentle to light-medium pressure for facial gua sha is recommended for an optimal technique,” she says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you clean a gua sha tool?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cleaning a gua sha tool is super easy. All you really need is soap and water. The care beyond washing requires a bit more effort. “Gemstone gua sha tools are durable and long-lasting when treated with care — however, they are still vulnerable to breakage or chipping if dropped and won't be suitable for continued use,” says Medvedich. “As gua aha stones can become slippery with soap or oil residue, be sure to take extra care when cleaning. Handle your gemstone gua sha tools the same way you would a sentimental piece of jewelry or your favorite porcelain mug."
