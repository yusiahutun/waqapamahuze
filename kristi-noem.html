She is the state of South Dakota’s 33rd governor. Kristi is both anti-Abortt and a protester and campaigned for the rights of those who lacked them. Noem is trying hard to bring a change in society and the perspective of people, although, quite often she faces hurdles. For the betterment of mothers and their families in the state, Kristi and her team have launched the website life.sd.gov. It’s the site that lets users input what kind of help they seek from them be it pregnancy, financial assistance, or adoption.</p><h2>Kristi Noem Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Husband, Net Worth</h2><p>On November 30, 1971, Kristi was born. Kristi Noem was born in Watertown, South Dakota, to Ron and Corinne Arnold, and grew up on their family ranch and farm in rural Hamlin County with her brothers. In March 1994, Noem’s father died in a farm tractor accident, a month before Noem’s daughter, Kassidy, was born. The family property was expanded by Noem, who built a hunting lodge and a restaurant. Her siblings returned to help with the business expansion. Noem won the South Dakota Snow Queen title after graduating from Hamlin High School in 1990.</p><p>She says the experience helped her improve her public speaking and marketing skills. Noem attended Northern State University from 1990 to 1992 after graduating from high school. She married Bryon Noem in Watertown, South Dakota, in 1992, at the age of 20, after dropping out of college early. Noem studied coursework at Mount Marty College in Watertown and South Dakota State University after her father died, as well as online programs from the University of South Dakota, from which she graduated in 2011.</p><h3>Career</h3><p>Kristi served admirably in the South Dakota House of Representatives from 2007 to 2011. Later she served as U.S. Representative for South Dakota’s at-large congressional district from 2011 to 2019. Her political prowess reached its zenith in 2018 when she clinched the governorship of South Dakota.</p><p>Noem’s political journey commenced with her election in 2006 to represent the 6th district in the South Dakota House of Representatives. She triumphed with 39% of the vote initially and secured re-election in 2008 with a robust 41% support.</p><p>During the COVID-19 epidemic, house orders were issued, like Anthony Fauci and Joe Biden’s policies. According to a CPAC straw poll, 4% of attendees want Noem to run for president in 2024, placing her third after Trump and Ron DeSantis.</p><p>A separate poll underscored her standing, revealing that if Trump opts out, an assertive 11% of participants favor Noem for president, placing her second after DeSantis. In a demonstration of unwavering commitment, she signed S.B.124 on March 10, 2021, originally crafted to shield churches during the pandemic. Critics, however, decry potential discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals, women, and minority religions.</p><p>This legislation, echoing the bold steps of Indiana Governor Mike Pence in 2015, marked a significant six-year milestone in the restoration of religious freedom. Noem further stoked the fires of controversy by robustly endorsing H.B. 1217, the Women’s Fairness in Sports Bill, via Twitter on March 8. The bill’s unyielding stance against transgender athletes participating in women’s sports ignited concerns about potential economic consequences for the state.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Kristi Noem Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Kristi Lynn Noem</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>November 30, 1971</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2024)</td><td>52 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Watertown, South Dakota, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Politician</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Kristi-Noem-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 7” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 170 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 58 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 128 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>7 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Slim</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Ron Arnold</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Corrine Arnold</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>Hamlin High School</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>South Dakota State University, Northern State University</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Kristi-Noem-3.jpg alt="Kristi Noem Governor" width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td>Who is her husband?</td><td>Bryon Noem</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Three (Kassidy, Kennedy & Booker Noem)</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Bryon Noem has been Noem’s husband since 1992.
