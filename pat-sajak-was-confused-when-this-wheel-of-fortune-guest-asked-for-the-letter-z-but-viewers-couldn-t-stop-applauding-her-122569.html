Fountano, who had done quite well in the previous rounds, started the last round by choosing the letter Z. A surprised Sajak even asks her to repeat her request to make sure that he heard her correctly. “As in Zulu. Z,” she confirms.</p><p>She follows up her guess with even more awful choices including “X” and “Q.” Fountano even goes over the time limit and looses her turn twice!</p><p>When the puzzle is completed, Sajak is quick to question Fountano.</p><p>“May I ask you a question?” he starts. “You called some unusual letters that round!”</p><p>“That’s what I saw,” is all she says.</p><p>MUST-SEE: <a href=#>TV’s Second Longest-Running Game Show Just Made a MAJOR Change</a></p><p>Viewers soon realized that Fountano had purposely lost the round so that her competitors, who were vets like herself, could win some money.</p><p>Thanks to Fountano’s “service over self” mentality, fellow vet Steve went from $1,600 to $6,400.</p><p>After initial confusion, people on social media tipped their hats.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This woman ROCKS!
