This season’s Heroes hail from New Orleans and have been nominated by their nearest and dearest to get some help from the Fab Five.</strong></p><p>In episode 4, Protect the Nest, viewers join Tan France, <a href=#>Antoni Porowski</a>, and co as they head to Louisiana School for the Deaf to meet Denton Mallas. For the first time in the <a href=#>Netflix</a> show’s history, <a href=#>Queer Eye</a> featured a deaf person in its cast and fans are hailing the episode as “eye-opening.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2024/01/QEYE_804_Denton_Unit_00448R-1-1024x683.jpg><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meet-denton-mallas-from-queer-eye>Meet Denton Mallas from Queer Eye</h2><p>Denton is Louisiana School for the Deaf’s Athletic Director who has a passion for football, but an even bigger passion for working with his Deaf students.</p><p>He found out he was deaf at 18 months old and his whole family learned sign language from then. Denton’s father became a football coach and encouraged him to partake in the sport.</p><p>Now, Denton is doing the same for the students at his school.</p><p>The Netflix star puts everything into his job. But, his wife worries he’ll get burned out at the pace he’s going.</p><p>She said: “…athletic director, head football coach, assistant basketball coach, weightlifting coach, you name it, Denton does it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-louisiana-school-for-the-deaf-now>Louisiana School for the Deaf now</h2><p>At the start of Denton’s Queer Eye episode, he explains he needs to do all he can to help his kids.</p><p>It appears he is still doing as much as he can for the school. Denton shares links to fundraising pages on social media. He also writes in his bio he’s now “Dean of Students and Athletic Director.”</p><p>The school gives a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shoutout</a> to Denton as he appears on Queer Eye, writing: “Denton’s journey is a testament to his resilience and dedication to making a positive impact to his students and our school. We are thankful to the Queer Eye team for supporting LSD students and staff!”</p><p>Per comments on Denton’s <a href=#>Instagram</a> posts, fans are keen to donate to the school and many say the episode had them in tears. One commented: “Thank you for all that you do for your community…”</p><p>Given Denton’s selflessness, many of the show’s viewers are taking to X (<a href=#>Twitter</a>) to say he needs to be “protected at all costs.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Denton giving JVN his sign name is just so sweet 🥹 <a href=#>#QueerEye</a></p>— Prajakta M.

I don’t see an interpreter lol”</p><p>The Netflix show’s interpreter replied: “No, I was standing off camera near them and voicing what Denton was signing.”</p><p>He added: “My voicing was only so the Fab 5 could understand Denton. For the episode, it was decided no voice over in order to honor ASL as Denton’s voice.”</p><p>Denton also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shares the sign names</a> he gave to the Fab Five since the show.</p><p>He shared the “deaf culture tradition” of giving a person a sign name after getting to know them.</p><p>Denton explained: “Not anyone can give a sign name,” adding the names all have meanings behind them.</p><p>WATCH QUEER EYE ON NETFLIX NOW</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqLWww9JomKaZqp67qHnQrpyeql2axqZ5x56pqGWimsOmrcusZJ%2BZkmKzqsLErGSsoZejeq%2BtzJ6qZqSVlsOqusZmnZqmo2KvosPLoqWg</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
