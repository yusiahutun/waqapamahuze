Scott posted a shot on social media of the family pup looking, well, kind of glum while observing one of the twins taking up all the room on someone's lap.</p><p>"Begging for attention or protecting one of his new little additions to our family? You be the judge," Scott humorously captioned the photo.</p><p>Poor Hobbs. We're willing to bet the little guy will adjust quickly, however, and start relishing his life as a brother to energetic girls who will no doubt keep him busy with plenty of cuddles, walks and games of fetch.</p><p>Scott, husband Chris Tyrrell and 4-year-old big sister&nbsp;Eisele welcomed twin daughters one day after the 2018 Grammy Awards. Betsy Mack and Emory JoAnn weighed in at a scant 5.5 pounds each at delivery, but we're betting they are a lot bigger now!</p><p>"Eisele is so excited to have her very own living baby dolls," Scott wrote as part of the&nbsp;<a href=#>baby gender reveal</a>. "Chris and I are beyond grateful that we get to raise a household of little ladies, and can't wait to watch and help them grow into kind, independent, and confident women!"</p><p>The couple have shared a number of precious moments from their life since the twins joined their family, including a recent shot of the girls <a href=#>meeting their "uncle,"</a> Lady A singer <a href=#>Charles Kelley</a>.</p><p><strong>Hillary Scott's Heartbreaking Miscarriage Story</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoaGcoa6zxYysmqispKh6scHPaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
