"In light of the current situation, we will not be proceeding with our plans for the Wonder Woman premiere and junket activities in London."</p><p>The red carpet event was scheduled for May 31.</p><p>The city of Manchester has been under high alert after the attack on concert goers became the most deadly terror attack on British soil since the 2005 London bombings. Police have said a man armed with explosives executed the attack on his own and died in the blast, but a 23-year-old man was arrested Tuesday in south Manchester in connection to the attack.</p><p>Initially, Grande's team had not officially suspended her world tour as they were assessing the situation.</p><p>Her manager Scooter Braun expressed his devastation in an <a href=#><strong>Instagram post</strong></a>: "Tonight, our hearts are broken. Words cannot express our sorrow for the victims and families harmed in this senseless attack/ We mourn the lives of children and loved ones taken by this cowardly act. We are thankful for the senseless service tonight of Manchester's first responders who rushed towards danger to help save lives. We ask all of you to hold the victims, their families, and all those affected in your hearts and prayers."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3a15cec0-b9a3-5d02-a281-6d57e99c7bce data-container-ref=toofab:article:a21a6f43-6e09-5b34-a39b-ffb86c06cafe data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6d/5by4/2017/05/23/6d87b8b214d75303be7f25739dc465fd_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Chaotic Footage From Ariana Grande Manchester Concert Terror Attack Floods Social Media (Video)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>President <a href=#><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a> has called those responsible for the concert bombing "evil losers."</p><p>And according to <a href=#>CNN</a>, that may be ISIS, which has claimed responsibility for the attack.
