Everyone was playing with it all night long and she danced and swirled in it for eight hours! It wasn't a simple dress but it had a purity in its design and its lines that I think really suited her."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e6043d76d68a-mary-wedding-dress-a.jpg><p id=eQTkqR_symSN data-wc=96>After eight fittings, Mary had crafted the "perfect dress" for her first bridal customer and in return, the designer was invited to the wedding in the Dominican Republic. "Carolina and I became really close friends throughout the process," said Mary. "She was so open and positive and even though I had never done a wedding dress before, she really trusted me to create the perfect dress for her. When it all came together I felt so humbled to be part of such a special day in her life. It felt like I'd known her for years."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a54cc52dd582-mary-wedding-dress2-a.jpg><p id=e9wF6UWOrEMfZ data-wc=53>For now, the brunette beauty added that she had no plans to design a full bridal collection. "It's such a great experience if you feel inspired by the person you are designing it for," she said. "It's a very intimate experience and a time consuming one, too, so it has to feel right."</p><p id=e27p1Vw319jc data-wc=23>Mary herself looked glamorous on the day, donning a white mini dress and leopard print cardigan, which she teamed with giant diamond earrings.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
