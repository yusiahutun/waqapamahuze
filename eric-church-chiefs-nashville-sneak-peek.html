Church is also documenting his own musical journey in the decor, papering the walls with his own concert posters, while simultaneously celebrating the roots of the building by revitalizing some of the decor from its previous inhabitant, Cotton Eyed Joe.</p><p>An interior rendering of the bar demonstrates both design choices in action: With the walls, ceiling and floor covered in concert posters, the visual depicts a bar with an overhanging vintage light system and "Cotton Eyed Joe" written on the windows in the background.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>Courtesy of Chief's / AJ Capital</span></p>Courtesy of Chief's / AJ Capital<p>loading...</p></figure><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>Courtesy of Chief's / AJ Capital</span></p>Courtesy of Chief's / AJ Capital<p>loading...</p></figure><p>Meanwhile, the exterior of the building shows the grand facade that Chief's will bring to Broadway, complete with an expansive marquee decorating the corner building.</p><p>As much as the bar honors the past, it will also look toward the future, and ensure that the fan experience at Chief's is one-of-a-kind. The establishment will be home to a ticketed music venue, as well as a studio for the singer's new SiriusXM Outsiders Radio channel, which -- along with the bar itself -- is being managed by Church's <a href=#>brand-new company, Solid Entertainment</a>.</p><p>Chief's is expected to open its doors to the public in 2023.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top 22 Country Songs of 2022, Ranked</h2>There are plenty of feel-good country jams on this list of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">top country songs of 2022</a>, but the No. 1 song is one of the best love songs of the decade. These 22 songs are ranked by critical acclaim, radio and sales success, and importance to the genre.Seven of the 22 artists made our <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Top Country Songs list from 2021</a> as well, but there are no repeats.
