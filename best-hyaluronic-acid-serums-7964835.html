It’s kind of the green juice of skincare: It’s everywhere, no one’s really clear on what it does, and everyone wants it. In a nutshell, this sugar molecule is found naturally within our bodies alongside collagen and elastin, all of which start to slow down as we age, allowing dryness, dullness, and fine lines to creep in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But here's the good news: Hyaluronic acid is humectant, and when it is applied to skin topically in the form of a serum or moisturizer, it becomes a moisture magnet, attracting water from the air and guzzling it down. This new surge of water content on the skin's surface can help a complexion look more youthful, with plumped up fine lines, and an all-over hydrated, fresh-faced vibrance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To weed out the ineffective wannabes, we spent two months and over 400 hours testing the buzziest HA-based serums out there on our own skin. With each application, we scrutinized our skin for increased levels of hydration, softer and less noticeable fine lines, and smoother, bump-free texture. We also honed in on the experience overall, especially the way each serum felt on our skin throughout the day, noting any lingering stickiness, residue, or heaviness, along with other potential annoyances, like scent, absorption speed, and lackluster packaging. After we collected and evaluated the data from our editors, we scored and ranked each hyaluronic acid serum to curate this list, only bringing you the ones that delivered the very best results.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-isdin-isdinceutics-hyaluronic-concentrate></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Isdin Isdinceutics Hyaluronic Concentrate</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Isdin Isdinceutics Hyaluronic Concentrate" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/CF7YTSMA3SRKEXPnQqlmL468_d0=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Isdin-Isdinceutics-Hyaluronic-Concentrate-1261d19906124ad6a34adc4bd1ced50d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermstore</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Texture</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This supercharged concentrate goes above and beyond just hydration to wipe out acne and skin to clear acne and even out skin tone using a unique combination of fermented ingredients and two different weighted hyaluronic acids.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It contains a small amount of added fragrance which may not make it suitable for extremely sensitive skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We hate to throw around the term “skincare magic,” but it’s the best way to describe how we felt about the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Isdinceutics Hyaluronic Concentrate</a>. It efficiently solved some of our biggest skin issues, including acne, dryness, and dull texture. Of course, this serum is better than any magic trick because the ingenious formula, which contains two types of hyaluronic acid and skin-barrier strengthening peptides, gave our skin a pillow-soft texture that was absolutely real.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From the jump, we noticed that our skin stayed hydrated all day, which is a stark difference from our typical complexion that turns flaky just a few hours after using a hydrating skincare product. We’d bet this effect is from the inclusion of a fermented marine bacteria called pseudoalteromonas. Recent research shows that the process of fermenting bacteria helps skin better retain moisture.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=2></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, the formula contains two different weighted hyaluronic acids: The lighter one is able to deeply penetrate the dermis, providing far more enduring benefits, whereas the heavier version sits closer to the surface, giving us an instantaneous glow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As much as we loved the immediate gratification of dewy skin, the long-term effects were even more thrilling. As we continued testing the concentrate, our acne-dotted chin began to clear, potentially due to the antioxidant-rich properties of lentil seed extract<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=3></span>. This little legume can soothe inflammation and protect the skin against outside environmental factors. Pollution is the biggest offender and often leads to blemishes. On that same note, emollients like lecithin boost hydration, preventing pores from overcompensating with excess oil, which in turn, leads to even more clogged pores. To boot, it made our textured complexions much smoother in the process.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, the formula is free of mineral oil and other comedogenic additives that trigger congestion and irritation, though we’d cautiously suggest it to our friends with extremely sensitive skin since it does contain an added fragrance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Skin Type: </strong>Combination, oily, dry | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Hyaluronic acid (low and medium molecular weight), biomarine, peptides, lentil extract |<strong> Size: </strong>1 oz</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=1544 data-sizes=750px alt="A person's face after using Isdinceutics Hyaluronic Concentrate" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3g6ZZkxZ12YABVJtXNmhmIV4Ers=/fit-in/1500x1544/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-hyaluronic-acid-test-isdinceutics-concentrate-amanda-mcgowan-01-98e2444aa32641ccb7f19a0c9406f9e4.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Amanda Mcgowan</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2016 data-sizes=750px alt="A person holds a bottle of Isdinceutics Hyaluronic Concentrate" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/b1EFp9bXRCg5Ua2a7hF1lV6vSKE=/fit-in/1500x2016/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-hyaluronic-acid-test-isdinceutics-concentrate-amanda-mcgowan-02-d204baec22bb43318e06d9885bb06d28.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Amanda Mcgowan</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-the-inkey-list-hyaluronic-acid-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tATo-pySx1wyWl8YIUs4bezdFAU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hyaluronic-acid-serum-5e52a9ebaf6642bfb7811c2db5088845.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Texture</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>We saw near-instant results, including brighter skin and reduced redness.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Application is a little difficult since the product doesn’t have a pump or dropper.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Inkey List continually <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>saves our skin</a> from disrepair, and its affordable products are even good enough for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>celebrities like Haim</a>, so it’s no surprise that we’re here espousing the brilliance of its hyaluronic acid serum. Its quick-drying formula has a gel-like consistency that sunk into our skin in under 30 seconds and left a lovely, even base for the skincare and makeup we layered on top of it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The post-application results were as speedy as its dry-down. Our skin drank up the two percent hyaluronic acid instantly, smoothing over the rough texture we had around the high points of our face. In fact, our skin stayed so well moisturized that on the rare instance we forgot to use the serum, it still felt incredibly soft and healthy. Additionally, its trademarked concoction of peptides prompted our bodies to make more collagen and gave our skin a bouncy, radiant texture after just a couple of uses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, the antimicrobial effects from the radish root extract killed any acne-causing bacteria<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=4></span>, and mitigated the sheen on our T-zone. These extracts also contain flavonoids, which are natural chemicals with antioxidant properties commonly found in plants, and can calm inflammation, which may explain why throughout testing we saw the redness around our cheeks almost completely disappear<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=5></span>. But what makes flavinoids extra special – and important – to hyaluronic acid serums is the fact that they are able to penetrate the deeper levels of the dermis, not just the top, most visible layer, leading to stronger, longer-lasting anti-aging results over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of application, the product squeezes out of a disc top cap (similar to a mini hotel shampoo) and though this wasn’t a huge nuisance, it would’ve been nice if it came with a dropper instead for an easier, more consistent application. However, if not having one is what keeps the price tag under $15, then we’re definitely not complaining.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Skin Type: </strong>Normal, dry, combination,<strong> </strong>oily<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Multi aolecular hyaluronic acid 2%, the brand's patented Matrixyl 3000 Peptide <strong>| Size: </strong>1 oz</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jaylyn Pruitt</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-dermatologist-tested-the-ordinary-hyaluronic-acid-2--b5></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Dermatologist-Tested</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/G0n82JxJ4to_GnURY1AEFffCw4U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/The-Ordinary-Hyaluronic-Acid-2--B5-900ef8a3d97b49448585a445b7535d5d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Texture</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>We put our skin through the wringer (Think: sun, pool, and plenty of outdoor time) and yet, you’d never know it from the look of our moisturized and flake-free visage.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Using too much of the product will create a sticky residue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Naturally, consulting with your dermatologist is key when finding a new skincare product, but a skincare product that was developed, tested, and approved by doctors, like this one, is your next best bet. In addition to three hyaluronic acids across a range of weights, dermatologists also concocted a hydrating sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer, and when mixed together, they deliver lasting, radiant hydration by locking moisture into the skin and throwing away the key.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even after spending many summer days in chlorinated pools and hours lazing around in the sun, this serum saved our skin from drying out and rewarded our skincare sins with a smooth, ultra-soft complexion. The formula leans on pro-vitamin B5, in the form of panthenol, to act as a powerful humectant and anti-inflammatory, shielding UV rays and arid weather from draining our skin barrier of moisture. And, though we weren’t congested at the time, panthenol is known to curb the growth of acne-causing bacteria, leading us to believe that it could be a possible preventative solution against breakouts.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=6></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though it felt lighter than air on our skin, it’d be easy to think we’d been applying a heavy-duty overnight treatment to get the visible results that we did.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One suggestion: Be cautious not to over-apply the product and use it on a slightly damp face to avoid any sticky residue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Skin Type: </strong>Normal, oily, combination, dry, sensitive<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Sodium hyaluronate, sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer, panthenol<strong> | Size: </strong>1 oz</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jodi Espinosa</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-dr-barbara-sturm-hyaluronic-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Barbara Sturm Hyaluronic Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dr. Barbara Sturm Hyaluronic Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/btyRBi2XM1QaOIcbwVGgZMFKVyM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Dr.-Barbara-Sturm-Hyaluronic-Acid-4e02962da7d442a384aa7723bfd5c4eb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Texture</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>With three types of hyaluronic acids in various weights, our<strong> </strong>wrinkles, fine lines, and dark circles looked far less visible.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You have to be patient to experience the best results, but (trust us) they are well worth the wait.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As it turns out, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Barbara Sturm</a> is a bit of a research nerd like us, and we’re endlessly grateful to the German-based brand for the way this science-backed formula brought new life to our dull, tired skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">So, how does the serum work? It’s all in the innovative ingredient lineup, starting with three types of hyaluronic acid that fit together like nesting dolls to yield a long list of results with every application. Almost immediately, we saw our skin brighten as it drank up the highest-weighted hyaluronic acid that slightly absorbed and stayed close to the top of the skin’s surface, whereas the medium-weighted HA refreshed the skin around our chin and cheeks. Over time, we spotted the effects of the low-weighted hyaluronic acid kick in — this weight sinks deeply into the dermis to target dark circles, wrinkles<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=7></span>, and fine lines right at the source.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, the mineral- and fatty acid-rich purslane soothed our flaky, cracked skin after we spent too much time in the sun. A member of the succulent family, purslane has been a celebrated anti-inflammatory and protective ingredient in Eastern medicine for years as a way to treat and heal wounds. With more omega fatty acids than fish oil and more vitamins than veggies, this extract is brimming with skin-supporting benefits, like revving up cell turnover, strengthening the skin barrier for improved hydration, and defending against free radicals and UV damage.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=8></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It took less than a month for our skin to look like we just came home from a long, restorative weekend spent at a five-star spa, but it was around the six-week mark when our skin really hit its stride.

Even those who have celebrity-sized budgets, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sarah Jessica Parker</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Natalia Dyer</a>, opt for the super effective, sensitive-skin friendly formulas from La Roche-Posay.

Known for its regenerative effects, this little herb has an outsized ability to improve the flow of blood through the body, which in turn, increases the supply of nutrients for the body to absorb, which strengthens the skin at the cellular level while also jumpstarting collagen production. Throughout the testing period, we watched our fine lines begin to soften, particularly around our eyes. We also attribute this delightful combination of the ancient herb with modern medicine as the benefactor behind our super dewy skin. In fact, our skin looked so dewy that the luminosity just radiated right through our makeup, eliminating the need for a brightening base primer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, dimethicone, a non-comedogenic silicone common in many smoothing face primers, further filled in our fine lines, delivered a glass-skin effect, and created a barrier against moisture loss<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=10></span>.

We have its pretty midnight color to thank for that, or, actually, purple rice extract. This ingredient gives the serum its groovy hue as one of its compounds, anthrocyanins, releases its deep red pigments that suppress inflammation and stabilize dwindling collagen levels.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Along with purple rice extracts, you’ll find one of the brand's patented inventions: Proxylane, a synthetic, eco-friendly ingredient derived from birch and beechwood to support the skin barrier, allowing it to better retain long lasting hydration and refine skin texture. What’s more, the rice extract has strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which we think accounted for the lack of redness and irritation we often see on our cheeks and may have helped clear up the acne on our chin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The serum wasn’t humble about its talents either. We watched our winter weather-beaten skin perk up like a freshly watered plant, especially when it came to our cheeks that shined with a natural highlight instead of an angry red flush of color. We credit this effect to the addition of licorice root extract which has an illuminating effect on the skin by slowing down the body’s production of melanin, which fades skin discoloration and prevents new spots from forming.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=11></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But that’s not all.

And boy, did our trust pay off. The formula’s powerful 1.5 percent hyaluronic acid combined with citric acid works to balance the skin’s pH levels, which we definitely noticed as our skin color moved from a red flush to a more even tone within weeks. Besides that, citric acid is known to combat oxidative stress — usually damage from pollution and UV rays, and if left unchecked, this damage will weaken the skin barrier, making it vulnerable to inflammation, along with a whole host of other unpleasant effects.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We saw skin-soothing ingredients, such as glycerin and sodium hyaluronate, calm our rosacea-related flare-ups.

releases hydration over time to keep skin moisturized for hours on end, alongside a faster acting HA for immediate dewiness, another long-lasting cross-linked HA, and two others to soothe and smooth

Another proprietary innovation from the brand, Vitisensce Technology, taps the antioxidants from vitis flower stem cells to strengthen the skin barrier, allowing it to replenish and sustain hydration levels on its own.

In fact, our dry patches soaked up the serum immediately and those flaky spots disappeared, revealing nothing but soft, even-looking skin.

First, it uses five different forms of hyaluronic acid to reach different layers of the skin and maintain moisture long-term. As if that weren’t enough, its formula includes skin-conditioning <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>plant oils</a>, like jojoba and sunflower, for added hydration.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-116 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And, as suggested in the name, it contains tea extracts, such as camellia sinensis leaf (AKA green tea), which contains compounds that can help inhibit hyaluronic acid from leaving your skin<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=20></span>. Translation: It kept all the moisture locked away safely in our skin barrier so we could experience less roughness and more luminosity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-117 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What’s more, tea is an anti-inflammatory that can increase blood flow circulation and give skin a more youthful appearance (hence how we were able to fake a look of a restful night’s sleep). It’s true that the sticky texture initially threw us off, leading us to question if there was something in the formula that would make us break out, but once it dried down into our skin, we couldn’t feel a thing.

Honestly, there were a couple of mornings when we forgot to apply it, and we didn’t even notice because our skin remained hydrated and happy for days after each application. Normally, our skin is so dry that it feels tight, especially around our mouth and forehead, but after a few days of using this serum, the taut sensation gave way to a relaxed comfort, and we started to notice fewer fine lines in these same areas, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-124 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This breakthrough ingredient of polyglutamic acid is likely to thank for the deep, long-lasting hydration we felt — some studies suggest it may even have more impact at promoting skin elasticity than collagen.

Next, our InStyle editors, across a range of skin types, textures, and concerns, incorporated their serums into their daily routines over the next eight weeks. We evaluated the serums for how well it made our skin look plump and hydrated, and whether it addressed other skincare challenges, such as acne or excessive dryness. We also considered other aspects, like how well it absorbed into our skin, if it had a noticeable fragrance, and whether or not it caused any irritation throughout the process.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We noted the length of time it took to see our results.

However, “the exceptions are other acids with low pHs, such as glycolic acid, which may degrade the HA and render it useless,” says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Rachel Nazarian. Instead, she suggests seeking formulas that use ingredients such as vitamin C to protect against free radicals or retinol to target wrinkles and improve skin elasticity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have super dry skin, Dr. Nazarian recommends a hyaluronic acid serum with emollients that will hydrate and soften the skin, like glycerine, squalene, and jojoba oil.

For example, Dr. Nazarian explains that “the type of HA we often like to use is sodium hyaluronate, because the molecular weight is lower, allowing it to penetrate more deeply into the skin.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Skin Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our experts agree that all skin types can not only tolerate hyaluronic acid, but each one will benefit from it in some way. “I like suggesting hyaluronic acid for people that are on a skin care regimen that may be somewhat irritating,” says Dr. Nazarian, who adds that the HA “tends to offset some of the irritation that is found with acne ingredients, or retinoids.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is hyaluronic acid?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Technically speaking, hyaluronic acid is a chain of sugars known as disaccharides found in the body's connective tissue, says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Mona Gohara, but from a surface level HA is a “little molecule that helps to absorb water into the skin — it’s a powerful, strong humectant that occurs naturally in our skin,” she explains.
