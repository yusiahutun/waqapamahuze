Schuyler, father to Angelica, Eliza, and Peggy, was a Revolutionary War general, U.S. senator, and businessman, much beloved and respected by his community. But he was also a prominent slave owner who believed abolition to be too large an inconvenience for slave owners.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As Ian Mumpton wrote <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://schuylermansion.blogspot.com/2018/05/ran-away-on-28th-ultimo-freedom-seekers.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="for the official blog of the Schuyler Mansion State Historic Site" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>for the official blog of the Schuyler Mansion State Historic Site</u></a>, “Philip Schuyler had little interest in abolition outside of the political capital to be gained as more and more politicians embraced the idea (in theory if not in their daily lives) … Even at the time of his death in November of 1804, at least seven people, including three children, still labored in slavery at his estate in Albany.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In recent weeks, this controversy has led Albany Mayor Kathy Sheehan to order the removal of a statue of the general from in front of Albany City Hall, according to the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Churchill-Saying-goodbye-to-the-statue-of-Philip-15336389.php data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Times Union" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Times Union</u></a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Angelica was not the only Schuyler child who eloped.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In fact, it would seem hopeless romanticism (and rebelliousness) ran in the Schuylers’ DNA. Yes, Angelica eloped and moved overseas with her husband, as Hamilton depicts, but <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://schuylermansion.blogspot.com/2017/10/the-rebellious-son-philip-jeremiahs.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to the Schuyler Mansion State Historic Site" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>according to the Schuyler Mansion State Historic Site</u></a>, a total of four Schuyler children chose to elope.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Catherine, Philip Jeremiah, and Cornelia also eloped—with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.hrmm.org/history-blog/guest-blog-the-women-of-schuyler-mansion data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cornelia’s husband writing," class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Cornelia’s husband writing,</u></a> “She leapt from a Two Story Window into my arms and abandoning every thing [sic] for me gave the most convincing proof of what a husband most Desire [sic] to Know that his wife Loves him."</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Eliza and Alexander actually met two years before the “Helpless” ball.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although Hamilton describes Eliza and Alexander’s love as nearly instantaneous, that wasn’t quite the case. The famous evening party when Alexander and Eliza meet, as depicted in “Helpless,” did in fact take place in reality.

But in reality, she didn’t introduce the two, nor could she have married Alexander anyway. By the night of that party, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/dutch_americans/angelica-schuyler-church data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she was already married to John Church" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>she was already married to John Church</u></a>, whom she shared two young children with.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Still, that didn’t keep her from striking up some flirtatious correspondence with her brother-in-law.

Although she gets the least screen/stage time of the three main sisters (apart from their absent other sisters, of course), in real life, she was a prominent ally of the politician’s. They were so close, in fact, that Alexander was at Peggy’s deathbed <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://dcmetrotheaterarts.com/2018/07/10/who-were-the-schuyler-sisters-fact-and-fiction-in-hamilton/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="when she died at the age of 42" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>when she died at the age of 42</u></a>.
