In fact, two bunkhouse boys are plants with roles only because they're so essential to the training and stunt work on set. Two more have a rodeo background and the belt buckles to show for it.</p><p>Then, there are stars like Cole Hauser and Ian Bohen, who play Rip Wheeler and Ryan on Yellowstone. Are they real cowboys?</p><p>The above video looks at the cowboy resumes of nearly a dozen actors on Yellowstone, including just about everyone in the bunkhouse and stars like Kelly Reilly, who plays Beth Dutton. Spoiler alert: she grew up in England, and there's a reason we rarely see her on horseback.</p><p>Teeter (actor Jen Landon) may have&nbsp;prairie experience, and her Instagram is filled with her on horseback, but she was pretty new to riding when she began. Fun fact about her: she missed Cowboy Camp, where creator Taylor Sheridan teaches the ins and outs of cowboying. That means she had to learn it as she went!</p><p>Lloyd, Laramie, Walker (actor <a href=#>Ryan Bingham</a>) and Jimmy are a few more whose cowboy credentials get assessed in this video. Check out the description section for a full list and fast-forward links to each one.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>22 'Yellowstone' Facts You Probably Didn't Know</h2>How big of a fan of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yellowstone</a> are you?

The actor's 5-bedroom-6-bathroom, 5,402-square-foot rural home on a very private, double-gated three-acre parcel of land includes the lavish 4-bedroom, 4-bathroom main residence, as well as a guest house and a separate studio apartment. The main house runs completely on solar power and comes with a 3-car garage, with easy transitions between indoor and outdoor living spaces, and the exterior of the property includes a pool area and a hot tub, as well as fenced-in horse corrals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmsKCZmLVuxcSlo6ivo6m8r7GMnKawmp%2BuwG6t0Z5kq52RoXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
