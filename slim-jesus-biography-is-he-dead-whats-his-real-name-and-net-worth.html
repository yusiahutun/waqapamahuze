He is a rapper from Ohio who had a semblance of success with his song Drill Time from 2015. Since then he has released several other songs like Drum Roll, Warning Shots, Buck Buck, Having My Way, Geeked Up and Let’s All Get Money; but none of the others have achieved the same success as Drill Time.</p><p>The rapper from Ohio started his success on YouTube. The video-sharing platform was responsible for the success of several other musicians who chose not to follow the normal or traditional path to musical fame. Nowadays, however, very few people follow the traditional path to success or fame.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Lori Greiner Bio, Net Worth, Husband, Children, Body Measurements, House</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Slim Jesus Biography – What’s His Real Name?</strong></h2><p>Before Slim Jesus exposed marijuana and money in social media, he was born and raised in Hamilton, Ohio. The rapper, whose birth name is Easton Phillips, was born in Hamilton on April 10, 1997, as the son of Irene Brown – a single mother.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Because he had grown up in a single-parent household, he had the unfortunate responsibility of having to “grow up” much earlier than necessary. However, from an early age, he developed a keen interest in music and proved to be a talented musician. When he was twelve years old, he began to take an interest in rap, and not long after that, he started posting his music and rap online, mainly on YouTube. However, it wasn’t until his song Drill Time that he achieved any kind of fame.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Slim Jesus Persona And Musical Influences</strong></h2><p>Despite his musical personality, many of those who know him personally have claimed that he has nothing in common with his “rapper” rapper personality. He has also been described as very friendly and calm. But despite his relatively calm disposition among friends, he is usually available for extravagant and excessive antics in public. For this reason, he has attracted the attention of the media and secured a place for himself in public.</p><p>He is considered one of the pioneers of a new rap style – “Drill Rap”, as his song drew attention to the rap style. Among the other notable drill rappers is Chief Keef, who is one of the outstanding influences of Slim Jesus in particular. His other influences include NBA Youngboy and Logic.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Slim Jesus Musical Reception</strong></h2><p>While his songs Buck Buck Buck and Drill Time had moderate success, the general response to him and his music was overwhelmingly negative. He was accused of cultural appropriation. Because of the accusations regarding his cultural appropriation and his rap style, which many said was “rigid,” he has very few fans who are African-Americans – who are the main consumers of rap music.</p><p>Because of his music style – he’s constantly rapping about guns, gangs, b*tches, murder, and things that he hasn’t been involved with, as it turns out – he’s often called “fake”. He is also regularly discussed in the conversations about “The White Male Fantasy Of Black Violence”, a topic of conversation that is rapidly gaining social importance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is He Dead?</strong></h2><p>At the moment the rapper from Ohio is still alive and making music – much to the satisfaction of his fans. Due to the death of other young rappers such as Lil Peep and Fredo Santana, rumors about the death of Slim Jesus keep coming up. Despite these rumors, Slim Jesus is not dead.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Molly Line – Bio, Husband, Net Worth, Height, Measurements, Fox News Career</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Slim Jesus Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Although he is known online for constantly splashing money on his various social media sites, especially Instagram – the rapper is said to be worth only $300,000.</p><p>To be honest, it can be argued that $300,000 isn’t all that bad considering his age and the amount of money the average American has. However, if you compare his net worth with that of some of his colleagues, it becomes clear why this amount is not very impressive. Lil Mouse has a net value of $1 million, Chief Keef also has a net value of $1 million and G. Herbo also has a net value of $1 million. Closest to his net worth is Lil Bibby with a net worth of $500,000.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Slim Jesus Height, Weight&nbsp; & Other Facts</strong></h2><p><strong>Full Name</strong>: Easton Phillips</p><p><strong>Profession</strong>: Rapper, Musician</p><p><strong>Height</strong>: ‎5 feet 9 inches</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: 52 kgs</p><p><strong>Race</strong>: Caucasian</p><p><strong>Nationality</strong>: American</p><p><strong>Date of Birth</strong>:&nbsp;April 10, 1997</p><p><strong>Place of Birth</strong>: Hamiton, Ohio, United States</p><p><b>Sexual orientation:</b>&nbsp;Straight</p><p><strong>Marital status</strong>: Single</p><p><strong>Astrological sign:&nbsp;</strong>Aries</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Slim Jesus Net Worth:</strong>&nbsp;$300,000</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kwK21zGahnqulqHqjtc6gqZqomK56qr%2BMoZxmnJWWsW7Dx5qrrGWYnsBuvsSao2amkaKybq3NnWSnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
