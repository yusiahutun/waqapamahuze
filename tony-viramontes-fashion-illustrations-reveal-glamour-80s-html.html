I thought that fashion illustrated by an artist would be very eye-catching and new. It evokes a dream, we sell dreams and romance [and] Tony knew how to do it with a few strokes.'</span></i></p><p><i><span>The intricacies of Valentino’s gowns inspired Viramontes to create some of his most defiantly high-fashion images. 'The clothes were so complex to draw, it was almost like an exercise,' remembers model Lisabeth Garber.<br></span></i></p><p><i><span>'Tony’s sketches were intuitive, right out of the hand.' 'He was quite free,' concurs Giammetti, 'he worked very quickly and if something did not work for me, he would redo it immediately.'</span></i></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn6Ta2pta2RkobC62GaNoqqRoryvwMSsZJ%2BZo522sLqMoqOlraOpv6LAyKilrGWimsOmrctmnqWZnaTCs3mXaapnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
