It's the anecdote you hear time and time again. But while I certainly remember my mom's signature scent—it was Cartier in my childhood and heavy on the vanilla—it's my own perfumes of years' past that instantly transport me back in time. After all, I've had quite the love affair with fragrance—and the collection to prove it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The first perfume I ever had was Cacharel's Anais Anais, which was released in 1978 and smelled like it. But oh how I loved that bottle. It was tiny and short, ivory-and-pink, and covered in girlish flowers. Although I never liked the powdery scent, I treasured every spritz. Soon after, my signature scent evolved into Philosophy's Amazing Grace, which I wore religiously up until the end of middle school. To this day, when I catch a whiff of it, I'm instantly brought back into my childhood bedroom, as if through teleportation, getting ready for school without a care in the world. It's a bubbly, youthful scent that anyone could love.</p><img alt="Perfume, Product, Beauty, Glass bottle, Cosmetics, Room, Material property, Glass, Bottle, Collection, " title="Perfume, Product, Beauty, Glass bottle, Cosmetics, Room, Material property, Glass, Bottle, Collection, " width=3857 height=2777 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-6108-1508860508.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jenna Rosenstein</span><p>A small taste of my current perfume collection.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As I turned 15 and 16 my taste in perfume evolved; I wanted something a little more sophisticated. First, there was my Marc Jacobs Daisy phase. I wore it on almost every "date" I had with my first boyfriend, which is probably why I still wince when I smell it (apologies to both Daisy and my first boyfriend—it's not you, it's me). There was the bottle or two of Miss Dior Eau Cherie that I sprayed through in record time. I was head-over-heels gaga for the scent—until Dior promptly reformulated it and discontinued the iconic caramel popcorn note. I was crushed. I also stocked up on bottles of Diesel Fuel for Life until that met a similar fate. The peppery, jasmine-and-patchouli scent earned me compliments almost everywhere I went, and I thought I would never be able to find a replacement.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But there was one scent I always cherished, admired, and respected—even if it wasn't one I reached for every single day as a young woman: <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nordstrom.com/s/dior-jadore-eau-de-parfum/2837670 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="J'Adore Dior" data-vars-ga-product-id=70c2c56e-25bb-4439-90b4-08c45c7177f4 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-href=https://www.nordstrom.com/s/dior-jadore-eau-de-parfum/2837670 data-product-url=https://www.nordstrom.com/s/dior-jadore-eau-de-parfum/2837670 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fdior-jadore-eau-de-parfum%2F2837670&u1=har|xid:{xid}" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"e263d99a-3772-4907-9ae8-cde76366d01b","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{"trackonomics":{"merchant_id":"689250","merchant_name":"NORDSTROM.com","network_name":"LS","network_id":"4","product_id":"459","product_name":"Harper&#39;s BAZAAR US","product_external_id":"459","product_url":null}},"network":{"id":"a332915a-6423-480f-9153-e3973f438607","name":"Trackonomics","metadata":{}},"product_metadata":{"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5":{"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fdior-jadore-eau-de-parfum%2F2837670&u1={subid}","network_name":"ls","appended_link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fdior-jadore-eau-de-parfum%2F2837670&u1={subid}|xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2023-09-14 10:42:59.800884"}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand=DIOR data-vars-ga-product-price=$85.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=300fe6db-c7c8-4fa5-80d0-91f8d5500bd3 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=DIOR data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Women's" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">J'Adore Dior</a>. It's easily one of the most iconic and successful fragrances of the modern era. It smells good on everyone, and I think that's partly the reason I shied away from the scent, at least at first. It felt so oversaturated that you couldn't pick-up a magazine in the early-aughts without coming across an ad for the scent. Everyone had it, everyone wore it. At 16 or 17, I felt like J'Adore was perhaps a little age-inappropriate for me. But I felt cool just owning it, and I loved displaying the elongated golden bottle on my vanity.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">More than a decade has passed—I've moved, graduated, become a beauty editor—and have since collected a nauseating amount of perfume bottles in my apartment. They collect dust on my vanity since I can only wear one at a time, spritz by spritz. I lie to myself about why I'm holding on to so many of them. It's not just because they're beautiful—it's because I am trying to rediscover my signature scent. I'm looking for a perfume that taps into my need for nostalgia but still reminds me that I am not, in fact, 17 years old. The addition of one more perfume has done just that; it's changed everything for me and my collection. One mist smells familiar yet sophisticated; comforting yet elevated.

It all starts in the jasmine fields of flower producer Carole Biancalana. At the farm Domaine de Manon, nestled between mountains on one side and the sea on the other, harvesters work tirelessly through the morning to pick thousands of rare Grasse jasmine flowers. The harvest lasts for 100 days. Brown wicker baskets are filled to the brim with the small white petals, then promptly shipped off to the perfume factory, where they're distilled into a potent and powerful jasmine essence called an absolut. That absolut—created with hundreds of thousands of jasmine flowers—is what makes the L'Or Essence de Parfum so special.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Back at the farm, Biancalana picked a handful of fresh Grasse jasmine, rubbed them in her palm, and explained that depending on various factors like the time of day or the day itself, the flowers can take on an almond, nutty, or banana-like quality. All it smelled like to me was fresh-picked jasmine. But when I had the chance to smell the jasmine absolut straight from the bottle, I was smacked in the face with the scent of bananas. The banana scent then drifted away as the various other facets of the flower—nutty, sweet, green, sensual—unfurled.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In this new scent, the jasmine absolut is mixed with rose absolut, then added to the iconic J'Adore vanilla base that makes the scent have such a mass appeal. Dior's Perfumer-Creator François Demachy noted that rose and jasmine exist in the original J'Adore, but L'Or's richer absolut content is what makes this new iteration so special. It's a rose perfume for people that don't usually love rose perfume. It's a floral for people that don't usually love florals. It's warm and sensual in a subtle way.</p><img alt="Yellow, Fashion accessory, Jewellery, Metal, " title="Yellow, Fashion accessory, Jewellery, Metal, " width=3000 height=1950 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/covers-y0415427-f041542709-1508782813.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Dior</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But while the scent may have a quiet boldness about it—the bottle does not. The original J'Adore bottle has been updated with a far more obvious hourglass shape. The gold cap that everyone knows and loves got an upgrade, too. The new yellow-gold neck has been engraved and etched so intricately that it looks a chain that's been wrapped around and around the bottle. From the new design to the juice, this fragrance is absolutely extra—in the best way possible. It's a complete surprise that all these years later, J'Adore has found it's way back on my vanity, this time as my new signature scent. The bottle may look a little different, and the scent may be a little more mature—but then again, so am I.<strong></strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Dior</strong> J'adore L'Or Essence de Parfum, $140, nordstrom.com.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/dior-jadore-lor-essence-de-parfum/4770267?origin=keywordsearch-personalizedsort&fashioncolor=MAUVE" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=SHOP data-vars-ga-product-id=f83aabc1-da40-4687-9532-7c4478469dfa data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/dior-jadore-lor-essence-de-parfum/4770267?origin=keywordsearch-personalizedsort&fashioncolor=MAUVE" data-product-url="http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/dior-jadore-lor-essence-de-parfum/4770267?origin=keywordsearch-personalizedsort&fashioncolor=MAUVE" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fdior-jadore-lor-essence-de-parfum%2F4770267%3Forigin%3Dkeywordsearch-personalizedsort%26fashioncolor%3DMAUVE&u1=har|xid:{xid}" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"e263d99a-3772-4907-9ae8-cde76366d01b","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{"trackonomics":{"merchant_id":"689250","merchant_name":"NORDSTROM.com","network_name":"LS","network_id":"4","product_id":"459","product_name":"Harper&#39;s BAZAAR US","product_external_id":"459","product_url":null}},"network":{"id":"a332915a-6423-480f-9153-e3973f438607","name":"Trackonomics","metadata":{}},"product_metadata":{"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5":{"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fdior-jadore-lor-essence-de-parfum%2F4770267%3Forigin%3Dkeywordsearch-personalizedsort%26fashioncolor%3DMAUVE&u1={subid}","network_name":"ls","appended_link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fdior-jadore-lor-essence-de-parfum%2F4770267%3Forigin%3Dkeywordsearch-personalizedsort%26fashioncolor%3DMAUVE&u1={subid}|xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2023-09-27 13:54:03.768153"}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand=DIOR data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=79241243-a845-42db-b462-01db13a7d305 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=DIOR data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Eau de Parfum" class="body-btn-link product-links-button css-1xbq6k6 e1aq0z090">SHOP</a><br></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital.
