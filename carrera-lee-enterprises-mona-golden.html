With the ever-growing list of HR processes, and the number of organizations dealing with it, implementing HCM has become a necessary element. HCM also gives organizations a competitive edge, giving them an efficient management system to work on. For employee productivity, they must focus on some value-adding work rather than doing repetitive tasks, making work even more time-consuming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Featuring for The Enterprise World’s issue of The Most Trusted HRMS Solution Providers, is Carrera Lee Enterprises, Inc., a company leveraging technology to revolutionize human resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Company&nbsp;-Carrera Lee Enterprises</h2><p>Carrera Lee Enterprises is a boutique firm that started its HR Tech consultancy with high-performance leadership training and a state-of-the-art LMS offering. While that was a great start, Mona Golden-Brown, Founder and CEO, was constantly thinking, “wouldn’t it be great if we could just…” – fill in the blank with her latest and greatest idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>These inspirations drove the company’s mission to provide a complete full suite of HR and workforce management solutions. <a href=# rel=noopener>Carrera Lee Enterprises</a> has since acquired the technical capabilities of one of the largest most powerful SaasSHR platforms from its strategic partner UKG.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a result of the partnership with this HRMS powerhouse combined with the inspiration provided by the time-tested research of Gallup and its findings around employee engagement and strengths-based leadership, Harmony Roze Saas HR was born.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Overcoming the Challenges</h3><p>Resources were the only challenge at the start. When the company started, the team was beaming with ideas but the only thing missing was the right kind of resources like money, time, or even people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, the name of the game was “Minimum Viable Product”, and to carry this out, Mona Golden also had to sacrifice some of her most brilliant ideas to get to the market.</p><p>As for how people resources went, her idea was to find the best, and most experienced people; the lifers that would hang in there with her through thick and thin. And it worked out very well.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Growth Quotient</h3><p>Overcoming the different challenges, what helped the company to get on the right track was the channel partner program. Once the team solidified their fertile garden of win-win greenery and then locked in the sales enablement program, things started to take off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“In summary, year over year, revenue has steadily been increasing around 35% during COVID, and we increased our staff by about 300% over the last 3 years.”</p><p>The organization takes care of its people–all of them. The team members, the partners, the vendors, the clients, and their people. Take care of others and it will come back 10-fold. Carrera Lee Enterprises keeps the client at the center of their story and makes them the hero.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>They marry high tech with a heavy concentration on high touch. The solution is designed to be a guide for the client to fight through the complexities of HR. Harmony Roze is intended to help clients through their difficulties and to win the day, every day.</p><p>They do this by helping them provide for the basic needs of their employees first, then as those lower-level needs are satisfied, progressing up the hierarchy through the need to feel that they belong, through development, and self-actualization. For example, making sure that employees always know what is expected of them at work, and that they can request access to tools they need to complete their jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>According to Gallup, which has been studying human nature and performance for over 75 years, addressing the fulfillment of these required needs can lead to a 22% reduction in turnover, and up to a 35% reduction in safety incidents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“By reducing the number of everyday stresses that the HR team is tasked with managing, we believe that we are helping to tame the overall complexities of their daily activities.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Their Suite of Products and Services&nbsp;</h3><p>Harmony Roze is comprised of an HR & talent management suite, a workforce management suite, and a benefits & payroll suite.

This is my strategy.”</p><p>“I’m not interested in the rat race because I don’t want to be one of the rats! You have to see yourself as a giant in a land of grasshoppers and have a positive, inspired outlook toward success. To keep this positive outlook, I insist on starting every day with the right mindset. I naturally wake up 3:30 – 4:00 (no alarm clock), get a little exercise in along with, meditation/journaling, a delicious cup of coffee, and planning for the day. Then I stick to it. No time for rats!”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZLCivtGeqZplnJqybrHNrZyrqKKewKa%2FjKamp5ldnLytsMSn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
