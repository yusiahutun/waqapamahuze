He was 35 at the time, and Carpenter was 27.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But it wasn't until 2008 that the dating rumors began. In the spring, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People reported</a> that the onscreen siblings had shared a "romantic" dinner in L.A.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We had a great base for our relationship," Carpenter explained in an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>interview with On Demand Entertainment</a>. "We see each other on a day-to-day basis. I know him; he knows me."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Eric Charbonneau/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carpenter and Hall made things official that New Year's Eve, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>eloping in Big Sur</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was nice to do it alone," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Carpenter later said</a> of the private ceremony. "I think it's the most personal commitment you could make. Even knowing that our families were with us in spirit, it was enough. It just needed to be the two of us."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-we-loved-them></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why We Loved Them</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though the romance was short-lived, it's clear there was (and is!) a lot of love between the actors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked on-camera to name the best gift they'd ever given each other during an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>interview in late 2009</a>, Hall was quick to provide a sentimental response: "Our lives." Carpenter, giggling, replied "agreed."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But the newlywed bliss was short-lived. While filming season 4 in 2009, Hall was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carpenter stood by his side through treatment and Hall was in "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>complete remission</a>" soon after.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's always felt like an opportunity to get closer and I'm just so impressed with him and anyone who's had to go through it," Carpenter told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Access Hollywood</a> of Hall's battle. "Every second's special with him, it sounds corny but it's true. I'm very lucky."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During this period, Hall won a Golden Globe for his work on the Showtime drama.

"He's one of the best we've got. He's an incredible talent and if anyone deserves accolades, it's him."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-breakup></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Breakup</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In December of 2010, nearly two years after their elopement, Entertainment Weekly announced that the Dexter stars were divorcing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Having been separated for some time, Jennifer Carpenter and Michael C. Hall have filed for divorce," a representative shared at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cue the frenzied spinning of tabloid stories …</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just days after the announcement was made, Carpenter and Hall's Dexter co-star Julia Stiles (who happened to play Hall's love-interest) released a statement hitting back at rumors that she had come between the former couple.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have absolutely nothing to do with the split between Michael and Jennifer," Stiles told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Us Weekly</a>. "We are good friends and enjoyed working together."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This is a personal matter between them, and we should respect their privacy," she clarified, "Although I too prefer to keep my private life private, I felt compelled to dispel the rumors I was somehow the cause for this matter."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike most exes who don't share children, Carpenter and Hall were unable to do the whole "time apart" thing. Dexter continued on with both stars for another three seasons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Less than a year later, Carpenter opened up about what it was like working with her ex during an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Today</a>. "Has it changed anything? Yes," she admitted. Still, she acknowledged that Hall "is and always will be one of my best friends in the world."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Just because the marriage ended doesn't mean the love isn't still there," she continued. "We take very good care of each other and our cast, we always have, and I'm just really lucky."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A couple months later, in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Fresh Air</a>, Hall echoed his ex-wife's sentiment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's a unique challenge, one that is unprecedented in my experiences," he said of working with Carpenter. "I haven't been able to compare notes with anyone about it. I think Jennifer is an astonishing actress. She remains a dear friend as well as a dear colleague. I think we take some pride in the fact that we've not just maintained our professionalism, but our sense of enthusiasm about the story. And the story continues for us. We're still in the other's life, in a different capacity I suppose, but it's an amicable situation, to say the least."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In early 2012, a smattering of reconciliation rumors arose after Carpenter and Hall were spotted on a series of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>seemingly romantic outings</a> (in all tabloid fairness, they were photographed cuddling on the beach at sunset). A People source dispelled the speculation quickly: "Jennifer and Michael are friends. They spend time together. They work together. It was not romantic."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When the cast gathered for a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>PaleyFest panel</a> ahead of the show's series finale in September 2013, an audience member (naturally) asked Carpenter and Hall to discuss working together post-divorce once more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Our marriage didn't look like anyone else's, and our divorce didn't either," Carpenter answered, tearing up onstage.
