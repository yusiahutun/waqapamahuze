What’s the point of having an Instagram account if you don’t look good in pictures, right?</p><p>Getting caught looking horrible in photos can be a tad traumatizing—and it’s enough&nbsp;to make us wonder exactly how all those models manage to look so&nbsp;damn&nbsp;good&nbsp;all of the time. Taking a great pic is a fine art—it’s a lot harder than it looks to make sure your in-the-flesh beauty translates on camera.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>The good news? Learning how to take the perfect selfie or photo and actually love the way you look in it is a skill you can totally master. Here are a few of our favorite tips.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/tips-to-look-better-in-pictures.png alt width=614 height=670 sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>1.</strong> If you tend to blink in photos, close your eyes just before the picture is taken and open them slowly before the camera clicks. No more half-closed eyes!</p><p><strong>2.</strong> To avoid a double chin, elongate your neck and push your face forward a bit. Think of sticking out your forehead and tipping your chin slightly down. It might feel awkward, but it will look great—promise.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Make sure your makeup is a perfect match, says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">mark</a>&nbsp;celebrity makeup artist <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Fiona Stiles</strong></a>, who has prepped everyone from <strong>Halle Berry</strong> to <strong>Jessica Chastain</strong>,&nbsp;and <strong>Elizabeth Banks</strong> for the red carpet. “When a foundation is too pale for your skin tone, it becomes very obvious when a flash hits the skin.” She advises, “Match your skin to your chest and add a thin layer to your neck if your neck is paler (as is the case for most people).”</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Curled lashes and mascara are musts, Stiles insists. “Both open up your eyes, and the eyes are the focal point of a picture. You want to draw people into a picture, so you want to maximize the impact of the eyes. They more open they are, the more the light hits them and that’s what makes them twinkle!”</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Take a look at your favorite pictures of yourself and try to spot a pattern. Do you like the way you look from a certain angle? When you smile a specific way? Try to replicate your best poses next time you have your photo taken.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Try this old-school red carpet trick: Put your tongue behind your teeth when you smile to avoid a goofy, too-wide grin.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> Fill in your brows. Not only do your eyebrows convey character and emotion, they often mean all the difference between looking wide awake and washed out on camera. You may even consider using a slightly darker brow pencil if you know you’ll be photographed, since features tend to look lighter in pictures.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Make sure your hair is shiny. “Spray-on shine is great for a last-minute add-on shine,” says hair stylist <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Serge Normant</strong></a>, who has worked with <strong>Julia Roberts</strong>, <strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong>, <strong>Julianne Moore</strong>, and <strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong> throughout his years in the biz.</p><p><strong>9.</strong> A photo can highlight flyaways, so make sure your style is sleek. “A good pomade or dry oil will help, but use lightly,” says Normant. “If you are afraid to use too much, spray on your hands and then lightly try to control fizz.”</p><p><strong>10.</strong> Look toward a light right before someone snaps your photo. Doing so will shrink your pupils and help you avoid red eye.</p><p><strong>11.</strong> Surprise photo op? Try this five-second prep: Blot your face with a tissue or single-ply cocktail napkin, then pinch your cheeks to create a rosy glow (yep, it’s old school, but it works).</p><p><strong>12.</strong> A couple drops of Visine will help your eyes look brighter and more awake.</p><p><strong>13.</strong> Blush is a must! Without some color on your cheeks, your face can look two-dimensional in photos. Use a medium pink shade on the apples of your cheeks to help shape your face.</p><p><strong>14.</strong> Think about angles. Facing the camera straight on is rarely flattering; instead, turn your head to a three-quarter position to give your features depth.</p><p><strong>15.</strong> Try the “red carpet” pose: Put your hand on your hip, angle your body to the side, and turn your head towards the camera. It’s a cliché, but it really does work to help you look slimmer.</p><p>MORE:</p><p><strong>16.</strong> Avoid serious sparkle on your face. “Anything too shimmery on the skin can just be too much in a photo,” says Stiles. “A soft glow is nice, but if you have oily skin it can really exaggerate shimmer and make you look very shiny. If you are a shimmer addict and just can’t help yourself, keep the face matte or semi-matte (a velvety finish). Add a little highlighter to just the tips of the cheekbones and the bridge of the nose with a powder highlighter that has a very soft sheen.”</p><p><strong>17.</strong> On the other hand, a bit of sparkle below the neck can give your skin a pretty sheen. Dust your collarbone and shoulders with a shimmering powder such as <strong>Natasha Denona All Over Glow Face & Body Shimmer in Powder</strong>&nbsp;($38 at <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Natasha Denona</a>), which has the perfect finish for playing up assets.</p><p><strong>18.</strong> Stand in front of a white wall. A light-colored backdrop will help brighten your face. Using a white background also helps a camera’s automatic settings find the right color balance, so your skin tone doesn’t end up looking too pink or yellow.</p><p><strong>19.</strong> Wear bright lipstick. “Dark lipstick can have a minimizing effect on lips,” says Stiles. “Steer clear of a dark matte lip color. It can look aging and unflattering. Stick with brighter colors.”</p><p><strong>20.</strong> Be in more pictures! People who think they aren’t photogenic tend to pose for fewer photos overall, but photography is a game of averages. Even Kate Moss doesn’t nail it on the first frame. The more shots you let your photographer take, the more likely you’ll be happy with one or two of them.</p><p><strong>21.</strong> A photo shot from just above you is way more flattering than one shot from below. If you’re taller than the person holding the camera, grab a seat.</p><p><strong>22.</strong> Avoid standing directly under a light, which can cast weird shadows on your face. Instead, stand facing a natural light source, such as a window, or in a spot where soft light hits your face from the side.</p><p><strong>23.</strong> Grab a prop—preferably not a red Solo cup. Holding onto an object such as a flower or decoration can help you relax your posture and add personality to a picture.</p><p><strong>24.</strong> To make your eyes sparkle, look at a light source. A lamp, for example, will create a flattering gleam in your pupils.</p><p><strong>25.</strong> Forget saying “cheese,” and instead think of something funny. Better yet, joke with the photographer. A natural smile trumps a fake one every time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/tips-to-look-better-in-pictures.png><p>A version of this article was originally published in May 2016.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2htZmiEdoGOoaawZaSkeqOxjKmfqKyfnLKvtcJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
