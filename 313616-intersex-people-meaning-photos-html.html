It forced doctors to put a question mark on the child’s birth notification papers instead of a gender.</p><p class=align-left>The woman went to the court to have three things clarified. Identify documents for the child so that he/she could attend school, a law to prevent surgery on intersex infants unless it is medically a necessity, and a thorough information/psychological support for parents to such kids. Five years later, in a landmark ruling, the court ordered the Kenyan government to issue all the necessary documents to the child, including a birth certificate.</p><p class=align-left>The High Court also ordered the Attorney General (AG) of the country to create a committee that would check into ways of providing support to intersex kids.</p><p class=align-left>The committee did its research and handed recommendation to the AG in April 2014. Their recommendations included delaying surgery for intersex children until they could choose for themselves and also doing a robust survey on their numbers. The task force also cited that an i-marker should be included as an intersex identifier that would be used in public documentation.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9e540943611a3f39_w.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Opinion: Kenya is a beautiful country suffering from deep-seated trust crisis</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Well, this led to this August’s survey being used to determine the number of citizens who do not identify as either male and female. The number of intersex people in Kenya is thought to be more than 700,000 out of a population of 49 million. However, the real figure will be known three months after the census exercise.</p><p class=align-left>The government will be seeking to obtain intersex statistics and details on the level of education, where they work, physical disability if any, among other vital things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/721cdd4b337821aa.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Intersex people in the upcoming census</p><h2>Intersex definition</h2><p class=align-left>Intersex people are persons born with sex characteristics, including chromosome patterns, gonads, and genitals that cannot fit typical binary descriptions of female or male bodies. Such variations may have genital ambiguity, sexual phenotype, and combinations of chromosomal genotype other than the widely known XY for male and XX for female.</p><p class=align-left>Formerly known as hermaphrodites or congenital eunuchs, Intersex is a term used to describe wide ranges of natural bodily variations. In some cases, intersex characteristics can be visible on birth while in others, the traits can’t be identified until the child reaches puberty. It is because not all chromosomal intersex variations are physically apparent to all the kids.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9c10f67496d8b60d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Somalia struggles in managing COVID-19 deepen as medics heap blame on health ministry</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Biologically, sex is determined by several traits and factors present at birth. They include the following:</p><ul><li>Number and type of sex chromosomes.</li><li>Type of gonads: Whether its ovaries or testicles.</li><li>External genitalia.</li><li>Internal reproductive anatomy, such as the uterus in women.</li><li>Levels of sex hormones.</li></ul><p class=align-left>People with characteristics that don’t fit in a typical male or female at birth are classified as intersex based on the above tests. Some children might be born with ambiguous external private parts while others obscure internal organs such as ovaries and testes. Others will become aware of their genotype when they undergo genetic testing because it doesn’t manifest on their phenotype. For this reason, thorough tests are done before finally concluding that the infant is an intersex.</p><p class=align-left>According to the UN, between 0.05% and 1.7% of the world population is born with intersex traits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9e540943611a3f39_w.jpeg><h2>What causes intersex?</h2><p class=align-left>Ambiguous sex organs primarily occur when hormone abnormalities interrupt or disturb the fetus’s developing private parts and organs during pregnancy.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a06caff722f7f7a6_w.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Edgar Obare: Kenyans on Twitter demand controversial blogger be released</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A baby’s sex is determined during conception just after sperms are deposited to the vagina. The mother’s egg contains an X chromosome while the father’s sperm can either have an X or a Y chromosome. If the X chromosome is inherited from the father, then the child is automatically a female. Similarly, for a Y chromosome, the genotype of the child will be a male (One X and one Y).</p><p class=align-left>Male and female organs then develop from the same tissue holding Y or X chromosomes. The process will highly depend on the presence or absence of feminine or masculine hormones.</p><ul><li>In males, a Y chromosomal region triggers the development of testicles, which in turn will produce the male hormones. Male parts will then develop as a result of the hormones from the fetus testicles.</li><li>In females, there are no Y chromosomes, so the effects of male hormones will not be felt thus the genitals develop as female.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e601d4bf6f1aec12.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Karen: Popular ape receives coronavirus vaccine in US zoo</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Nonetheless, a chromosomal abnormality can also determine the baby’s sex extra complex.</p><p class=align-left>This disruption can result in a mismatch between the appearance of private parts and internal sex organs or even the genetic sex (XX and YY).</p><ul><li>A deficiency/lack of male hormones in a genetically male fetus may result in intersex.
