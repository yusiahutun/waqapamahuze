However, even after the affair has ended, the emotional attachment to the affair partner might be difficult to shake.</p><p class=align-left>Signs that your husband might struggle to let go of his affair partner may start showing. So, how do you know your husband still has feelings for an affair partner?</p><h2>8 signs your husband misses his affair partner even after ending it</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9b1b8a636b616304.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Signs of unspoken attraction between coworkers to notice</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Discovering that one partner has been cheating is a scenario that many couples dread. While the initial pain of the affair may eventually subside, it's not uncommon that, as a betrayed partner, you worry that your husband is still in love with his affair partner, even after the infidelity ends.</p><p class=align-left>If you suspect he is struggling with residual feelings for his former lover, there are several signs to look out for. They could indicate he is still missing his lover. Here are the 8 signs:</p><h3>1. He becomes suddenly withdrawn or distant</h3><p class=align-left>Have you noticed your husband suddenly being more introverted? If he seems less interested in spending time with you than he used to, it could indicate that he is struggling with his emotions and missing his affair partner.</p><p class=align-left>If he truly longs for his lover, he may seem less engaged in conversations with you, mostly preoccupied with his thoughts or avoiding eye contact. A man who is trying to avoid facing his emotions or the reality of the situation will start spending more time alone or away from home.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/18d1d2ec68c66732.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>13 signs he thinks you're not good enough for him to date you</span></p></a><h3>2. He talks about her frequently</h3><p class=align-left>Whether during an argument or randomly, your husband shouldn't talk about his affair partner, knowing it would hurt you.</p><p class=align-left>If he is still bringing up his affair partner in your conversations, it could be a painful sign he is still thinking about her, and it may leave you wondering, "How long does it take for man to forget his affair partner?"</p><p class=align-left>Having invested his emotions in the affair partner may cause nostalgic feelings now and then.</p><p class=align-left>He may mention her name or something related to the <a href=#>ended relationship</a> in a casual conversation or when talking about certain events or places that remind him of her. This can be painful for the betrayed spouse, as it may feel like the mistress is still present in the marriage.</p><h3>3. He keeps mementoes or reminders of his lover</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9b1b8a636b616304.jpg><p class=align-left>Another sign that husband still has feelings for affair partner is if you notice that your husband still has pictures, messages or gifts that remind him of his lover.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2a92aab6cb143442.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Little Brian Excited to Learn Ladies in Germany Don't Ask Boyfriends to Send Fare for Dates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It could indicate how much he struggles to let go and move on. Although he keeps these items hidden or stored away, their presence and negative vibe can still be felt in the marriage.</p><p class=align-left>Such reminders make it difficult for the betrayed partner to trust their husband's full commitment to the marriage. If you notice such items, have an open conversation to determine if your husband has ended the affair.</p><h3>4. He seems less interested in physical intimacy with you</h3><p class=align-left>This affects a large percentage of any married man with multiple mistresses. And if your husband is showing less interest in <a href=#>physical intimacy</a> with you, it's a possible sign he is still processing his emotions related to the ended affair. There are two possible explanations for such behaviour.</p><p class=align-left>He may feel guilty or ashamed about his actions and struggle to be affectionate with his spouse. Or he may be comparing his past experiences with his affair partner to his experiences with you and finding them lacking. If the latter is the case, he is missing her/him, making it difficult to connect physically with you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/179a71272e2b2899.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ save the date quotes for a wedding: Best, funny, and cute ideas</span></p></a><h3>5. He becomes more secretive with his phone or computer</h3><p class=align-left>If your spouse starts guarding his phone or computer more closely, leaving it switched off without a good reason, it is a warning sign he is hiding something related to his affair partner. If you access his devices, he may be worried that you will discover something incriminating, like communicating with his lover.</p><p class=align-left>This behaviour erodes trust in the marriage, making it difficult to rebuild a sense of security and openness simply because your husband is missing and talking to his affair partner.</p><h3>6. He becomes defensive or irritable when you bring up the affair issue</h3><p class=align-left>If your husband is fully committed to your marriage, he will listen and try to understand where your insecurities are coming from. But if he becomes defensive or angry when you try to talk about the affair, it's a tell-tell sign he is still struggling with his emotions for his lover and wishes to avoid the topic.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bfb52626ba1beb41.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to make your angry girlfriend happy over text in 10 ways</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He may feel ashamed about his actions and find it difficult to confront them directly or be defensive because he can't get over the cherished thoughts of his affair partner. He shouldn't be attached to such feelings if he truly doesn't miss his mistress.</p><h3>7. He seems to be going through the motions in your relationship</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/18d1d2ec68c66732.jpg><p class=align-left>If your husband is going through the motions in your marriage without showing much enthusiasm or engagement, he is still emotionally invested in his affair partner. So how long does it take for a man to forget his affair partner? As soon as you find out about your husband's affair, he should cut off all ties with her/him if he values you.</p><p class=align-left>If he seems distant, distracted, or disinterested in the things that used to bring him joy, it might be because he <a href=#>struggles to move on</a> from the affair. This is a painful experience if you are the betrayed spouse, as you may feel like your husband is no longer fully present.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d4a98aef316017a2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How does a man feel when a woman walks away? 15 different ways</span></p></a><h3>8. He is more expressive about his feelings for her</h3><p class=align-left>It reaches a point where your husband misses his affair partner too much that he no longer hides it or cares about your feelings. If you notice him sending her more DMS on Instagram with things that resonate with his feelings for her, you should know that that's a sign he misses her/him and hence make an informed decision.</p><p class=align-left>When he longs for his affair lover, he will not be vulnerable about his emotions and thoughts with you, but he is completely open with her/him. Even if it's difficult for men to express emotions, your spouse will convey how much he thinks about his experience with the mistress.</p><p class=align-left>Recovering from infidelity in a marriage can be challenging as it leaves lasting scars. Out of insecurities from the betrayal, you will naturally want to know if your husband is over his affair partner and thus watch out for such signs. If you notice several signs your husband misses his affair partner, having an honest conversation with him is a good idea.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b321abc9442b6716.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>My husband looks at other females on Instagram!
