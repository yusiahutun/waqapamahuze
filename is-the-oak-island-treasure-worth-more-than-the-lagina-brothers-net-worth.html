Many have called their activities on the island a wild goose chase.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the activities of the filial duo have so far made them some notable bucks. There is no public figure of the actual amount the Laginas have made from Oak Island, but we can estimate.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=%E2%80%98X_Marks_the_Spot></span><strong>‘X’ Marks the Spot&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Oak Island is a privately owned small island off the coast of Nova Scotia in Canada. It has always been rumored that a stash of treasure that belonged to Captain Kidd was buried there around the 18th century.</p><p>Various treasure hunters have launched expeditions to claim the legendary booty of Captain Kidd on the island. However, the Lagina brothers are the most prolific occupants of the historic piece of real estate.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: </strong><a href=#><strong>Researchers Find Potential $37 Billion Treasure on $2 Million Coal Mine</strong></a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Filming_the_Journey_of_Treasure_Hunters></span><strong>Filming the Journey of Treasure Hunters&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Laginas’ search for treasure on Oak Island became a rave when the History Channel decided to film their treasure hunts. In 2014, the channel started filming the various sophisticated methods the brothers are using to pan for the island’s hidden treasures, calling it the Curse of Oak Island.</p><p>The Lagina brothers’ interest in the Oak Island treasure was inspired by a 1965 edition of Reader’s Digest. Rick Lagina stumbled on a piece about the island while reading the digest as an 11-year-old boy.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Making_Millions_From_a_Childhood_Dream></span><strong>Making Millions From a Childhood Dream</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Interestingly, the Laginas have not always been treasure hunters or TV sensations all their lives. They were simply responsible adults who kept the light of their childhood dream flickering.&nbsp;</p><p>It is presently estimated that Rick Lagina is worth $2 million, while his junior brother, Marty, is worth between $40 million and $60 million. However, it is interesting to know that their wealth did not all come from Oak Island. On the contrary, the Laginas have been industrious before the big break of the Curse of Oak Island.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Trained_to_Be_a_Hunter_of_Seismic_Treasure></span><strong>Trained to Be a Hunter of Seismic Treasure&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marty Lagina is a Science and Mechanical Engineering major who graduated from Michigan Tech in 1977. He also obtained a law degree in 1982 from the prestigious University of Michigan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Marty would spend the early years of his career working for various oil firms. However, he started an energy company of his own, Terra Energy Limited, which he would later sell for a whopping $60 million.</p><p><strong>POLL — </strong><a href=#><strong>Should the Government Increase Taxes on the Wealthy To Reduce Economic Inequality?</strong></a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Investing_in_a_Childhood_Dream></span><strong>Investing in a Childhood Dream&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On the other hand, Rick Legina has always been reclusive, and little is known of his career progress. However, we know he was a diligent man who spent his early years with the US Postal Service.</p><p>However, after Rick’s retirement, Marty funded his elder brother’s long-time dream of treasure hunting on Oak Island. So, the duo united to buy a 50% stake in Oak Island Tours Inc.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bringing_Expensive_Equipment_to_Prospect_in_the_Rough></span><strong>Bringing Expensive Equipment to Prospect in the Rough</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Oak Island private property originally belonged to Dan Blakenship, who has been panning for treasures on Oak Island alongside his son Dave as far back as the 1970s.&nbsp;</p><p>The upper hand that the Lagina brothers have on the island is technological. Marty pointed out during an interview, “It takes more than a shovel.” As the History Channel show reveals, the Legina brothers bring experts and sophisticated equipment to the island for the excavations and other search activities.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Showbiz_was_the_Cash_Spinner></span><strong>Showbiz was the Cash Spinner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While the cost of the Lagina brothers’ 50% stake in Oak Island Tours Inc. is not public knowledge, one thing the public knows is that The Curse of Oak Island show was a financial success.</p><p>Before the show began, remember the brothers were estimated to possess a combined wealth of around $47 million. However, the duo are said to be worth more than $100 million.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: </strong><a href=#><strong>Historic Wyoming Ranch Goes Back on Sale for $67 Million&nbsp;</strong></a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Finally_Striking_Some_Treasure></span><strong>Finally, Striking Some Treasure&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Indeed, the Legina brothers did not find a hypothetical treasure chest on Oak Island. Nonetheless, they found some historical artifacts that will contribute significantly to the history of the island and its Mahone Bay.</p><p>So far, some of Oak Island’s most notable finds are a 12th-century manuscript, a Spanish copper coin, a lead cross from the 13th century, and a stone slab from 1804, to mention a few.</p><p><strong>You Might Also Like:</strong></p><p><a href=#>Chicago Police Officer Sues City for Refusing to Allow Him Change His Race</a></p><p><a href=#>Group Slams Florida College With Rare Sanction Over Its “Politically Motivated Takeover”</a></p><p><a href=#>Workers at Unmarked Arizona Building Refuse to Answer Questions About Housing Migrants</a></p><p><a href=#>Nassau County Bans Transgender Athletes From Women and Girls’ Sports at County-Run Facilities</a></p><p><a href=#>Tennessee Pastor Takes the Gospel to the Streets, Feeds Families in Food Deserts</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktrR506GcZqeRoHqqv8uapZ1lpKeyor%2FUq5xmr5%2Bnwal5zKipnmWkna6vedOhnGakkZy2r62Mm6morJiav7R5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8Gpew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
