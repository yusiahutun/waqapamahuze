"My dad had me -- this is really bad, but he can't go to jail, I don't think, because it's a long enough time away."</p><p>"He had me in a baby backpack and I was on a dirt bike with my dad," she continued. "And he was riding and a tree had fallen and he ducked. I didn't and I hit my head on the tree."</p><p>"It was bad," she added. "So that's what's wrong. Everyone’s asked me that for years."</p><p>Rogan then explained how "wild" people like <a href=#>Roseanne Barr</a> and Sam Kinison both suffered injuries when they were young that changed their personalities.</p><p>"Maybe it knocked me into this identity or something," Cyrus offered. "When I get really overwhelmed I also have a tendency when I know something's really stupid, I just gotta try it, to know that it's stupid. Which makes it stupid because I already knew about it."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:37262d85-6807-4594-bc60-d432cbaf9da0 data-container-ref=toofab:article:eb89c5a7-f958-458e-adc3-8c8b9e46e27b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7f/5by4/2020/09/02/7f31239c61c54b42be01684321f5b2cb_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty/YouTube</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Miley Cyrus on Why Her Divorce from Liam Hemsworth 'F--king Sucked'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>“Sometimes I’m like, is it better to know it’s dumb and do it? Or not know it’s dumb and do it? That’s the head injury.”</p><p>Later, when the accident was brought up again, Rogan mused, "As a dad that's hard to hear."</p><p>Cyrus quipped, "I've given him an award for worst dad ever."</p><p>In the same interview, Cyrus <a href=#>dished on her divorce</a> from <a href=#>Liam Hemsworth</a>, saying it "f--king sucked."</p><p>"What really sucked about it wasn't the fact that me and someone that I loved realized that we don't love each other the way that we used to anymore. That’s okay, I can accept that," she said. "I can't accept the villainizing, and just all those stories."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4a1c8b4c-5353-4862-8ced-48bb90635830 data-container-ref=toofab:article:eb89c5a7-f958-458e-adc3-8c8b9e46e27b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6c/5by4/2020/08/14/6cc7fbf0815f408aa775eccdb8e5f70a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Miley Cyrus Says She Lied to Liam Hemsworth About Losing Her Virginity</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"It's amazing to me the public thinks that there's no gap of time that they didn't see that could possibly be what led to this," she continued. "It's not, 'One day you were happy on the carpet and the next day you were making out with your friend in Italy, what the f--k?'"</p><p>Cyrus appeared to be referring to her short romance with <a href=#>Brody Jenner's</a> ex <a href=#>Kaitlynn Carter</a> during an Italian getaway after the two women split from their respective husbands.</p><p>Speaking of her life as a single woman now, Cyrus told Rogan, "I don't need to be in a relationship at all."</p><p>Cyrus and Hemsworth got hitched in December 2018. By August of 2019, the two had gone their separate ways.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
