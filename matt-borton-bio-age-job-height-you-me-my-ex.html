Now, here’s the problem. His new girlfriend also lived in the same house! A perfect drama to be featured on </span><i><span>You, Me & My Ex</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Keep reading this Matt Borton Bio to learn more about him.</span></p><h3><b>Matt Borton On You, Me & My Ex</b></h3><p><span>TLC is well-known for its messy binge-worthy shows like </span><i><span>90 Day Fiance</span></i><span>, and to spice up the list, the channel introduced yet another unconventional relationship show</span><i><span> You, Me & My Ex</span></i><span> in 2021. It followed followed several couples, where one partner was unwilling to let go of their ex for one reason or another.</span></p><p><span>Two years later, the show then returned for its second installment, and it brought back three old couples Loren, John, April, and Roy; Jennifer, Chantel, Danielle, and Josh; and Alex, Caroline, and Stephen; and two new couples DeAndre Asbury-Heath, Rowan, and <a href=#>Elodie</a>; and Matt and his girlfriends.</span></p><h3><b>Is Matt Borton Still In A Relationship With Kenzie?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, as of April 2023, Matt Borton is still in a relationship with <a href=#>Kenzie</a>.

Guess, the two were able to make it through the unconventional situation after all.</span></p><p><span>In case you missed the drama, Matt started dating Kenzie circa 2019 — a month after he broke up with Chelsea.
