That’s why we upgraded the fire to level three.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ng added the blaze started on the first and second floors of the building, with signs it originated from an electrical switch room.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said the fire installations in the building – including auto-sprinklers, manual alarm systems and detectors – were shut down due to major renovations being carried out from the first to fifth floors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If the system is under repair, it’s possible the contractor will shut down the area affected,” Ng said, adding that alarms on other floors were unaffected.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said fire services were investigating and would follow up with the building operator.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sun Hung Kai Properties, which owns the building, said its service centre had immediately assisted emergency teams to evacuate tenants and customers.

If we didn’t make this call we would still be waiting upstairs.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lucas Lam, 25, who works inside the building, managed to escape on his own from the site at 3pm with a group of his colleagues. He said firefighters had told him the blaze was “under control”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As we work on the 32nd floor, at first we remained on the [rooftop] to stay away from the heavy smoke,” Lam said, adding that he and colleagues later found some stairs that offered them a safe passage out.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lam added that he saw a crowd of more than 100, including the elderly, on the rooftop.
