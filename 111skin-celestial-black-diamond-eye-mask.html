And in a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>2021 interview with&nbsp;Glamour</a> that recently resurfaced thanks to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>British&nbsp;Vogue</a>, she gave us the lowdown on what she does to relax after a full day’s work. “My nighttime routine is all about winding down and having some time to myself. I love to have a glass of wine in the bath any chance I get and read a good book,” she shared, “If I have the extra time, I love to wear <a href=# id=auto-tag_eye-masks data-tag=eye-masks>eye masks</a> to revitalize tired eyes after a long day.

The patches are packed with hero ingredients like&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/beauty/skin-care/1113767/best-hyaluronic-acid-for-skin-amazon/>hyaluronic acid</a>, which delivers much-needed hydration, and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/beauty/skin-care/672695/how-to-use-retinol/>retinol</a>, which works to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles over time. Paired with a powerful peptide complex and hexapeptide, which works to tighten and smooth skin in the under-eye area, and skin tone evening vitamins, and you’ve got a winning formula.

Tons of reviewers rave about the patches, swearing that they give the “best results” they’ve ever had with an eye mask. “At 47 years old, I often get dry skin and fine wrinkles under my eyes and puffiness sometimes, too,” writes one shopper, “This eye mask smooths the skin and calms the puffiness down, and I look and feel much more awake and, I swear, younger!”</p><p>“I have tried so many eye masks and these are definitely the best. They do exactly as they say they do and the results are instant,” writes another reviewer, “I can’t recommend these enough and if anyone is considering buying these, do it now…you won’t be disappointed.”</p><p>You can <a href=# id=auto-tag_shop data-tag=shop>shop</a> the <a href=# id=auto-tag_eye-patches data-tag=eye-patches>eye patches</a> at <a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/pmc_0aaa4_stylecaster?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D87443X1593552%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3DSC--%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252F111skin.com%252Fen-us&p=https%3A%2F%2Fstylecaster.com%2Fbeauty%2Fskin-care%2F1610987%2F111skin-celestial-black-diamond-eye-mask%2F&ref=pmcTrackonomicsReferrer&event_type=click" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">111SKIN’s website</a>, with <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://go.linkby.com/FODMYZWI/en-us/products/celestial-black-diamond-eye-mask rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">single masks</a> priced at just $17.
