at that time, Americans accounted for 49 per cent of the land owned by foreign property investors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, now Chinese property owners owned about 43 per cent of the total land area held by foreigners – twice the area of land owned by American property investors, reported the Aju Business Daily newspaper.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If the pace of property investment continued at the same rate, mainlanders would own more than 7 million sq m of property on the island by the end of this year, the report said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jeju Island is geographically close to China, and mainlanders consider it as a convenient base for commuting to cities in northern China; it is only a one-hour flight from Shanghai, and a two-and-a-half hour flight from Beijing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So far foreign investors have bought properties totalling an area of 13.73 million sq m on Jeju Island, which accounts for only 1 per cent of the total land area there.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Jeju provincial government and the Ministry of Justice launched the investment programme to raise funds and internationalise the island, but many local residents remain sceptical of a trend that they have described as “China money”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Chosun Ilbo report quoted a South Korean legislator saying that land owned by Chinese property investors had grown so large within such a short period of time that it could lead to unknown problems.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The legislator had also called for review of the positive and negative impact of Chinese investors buying large numbers of properties on Jeju Island.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miYrKGRZK6zwMico55nYWqFdYCUamasraKcsm6vx6KlnquVYravwsSsq6iqo2LAsMHToWSkp6KarrR5yZ6hrmWZqLmiusNmaWloaWK6osWMm5xmq5WYwrOx</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
