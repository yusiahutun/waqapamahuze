If you’re yearning to infuse your lengths with an added dose of warmth that channels the season, you might consider the current go-to hue: red.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From the runway to the red carpet, celebrities have embraced this passionate shade. Stars like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Megan Fox</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Lucy Boynton</a> have proved that red hair is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>ultimate fall accessory</a>. But it's not just about the star-studded appeal—red hair in the fall offers practical benefits, too. As temperatures drop, fiery locks can add a radiant warmth to your overall look, complementing cozy scarves and autumn wardrobes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, why is red hair trending? The answer lies in its timeless appeal and vast shade range. “There are so many shades of red, which makes it the perfect hue for fall,” says celebrity stylist Dimitris Giannetos. “Whether you opt for a fiery auburn, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sultry copper</a>, or a deep burgundy, there’s a color that will suit you.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re wondering if the world of red hair is for you, we’re here to help you decide. We reached out to a few experts to share everything you need to know about red hair, along with some of their favorite looks.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-red-hair-colors-for-different-skin-tones></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best Red Hair Colors for Different Skin Tones</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The spectrum of red is broad, so knowing what color will work for you can be challenging. Our experts advise seeking professional advice, but there are a few general tips that can help with your decision.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For dark skin tones, deep, rich coppers and violets have a way of bringing a beautiful glow to light, say the experts. “Darker skin tones can also pull off quite the range of vivid reds. The main thing here is making sure the style you go for complements the vivid red,” says Brown. “One look I love to see on darker skin tones are dimensional reds. Whether the dimension is created with different reds, or even using the red to create pockets of dimension while keeping the natural color in there as a lowlight. This is exceptionally beautiful on individuals who have curls and coils.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When it comes to medium skin tones, your options are pretty endless,” says Brown. “As long as you don't have a lot of underlying red in your complexion, you can literally run the gambit on reds. Try any and everything.”&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For medium-to-light skin tones, Brown recommends rich coppers or more vivid and vibrant reds. However, if you have a lot of red in your natural skin tone, or if you suffer from something like rosacea, the stylist says vivid reds can sometimes make this&nbsp;more obvious.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“For skin tones that are on the fairer side, you'll want to stick with soft copper or ginger reds, or even rich strawberry tones that have some depth to them,” says Brown. “If you're not a fan of copper or strawberry, you can still dive into more pigmented reds if you have fair skin, you'll just want to stick to the more neutral reds.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-maintain-red-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Maintain Red Hair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All the experts agree that dyed red hair is prone to fade and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>requires regular maintenance</a>. “Red hair fades fast, so using a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner is a must,” says Michael. “I would also recommend using a color depositing glaze at home to maintain the color and keep it vibrant.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have straight hair, Brown recommends <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Redkens Color Extend Magnetics Sulphate-Free Shampoo</a>, and for waves, curls and coils, she recommends <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Mizani Press Agent Smoothing, Frizz Control Blow Dry Styling Serum</a>. “Both of these lines are sulfate-free and color-safe, so you aren't stripping the red from your hair," says the stylist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Using heat protection is also a must if you want your red hair to stay damage-free and healthy. “Whether you have straight, wavy, curly, or coily hair, avoid putting heat on your red every day — try to space it out,” says Brown. “When you do use heat, be sure to use heat protection like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Mizani Style Shifter Society Heat Screen</a>, which protects from up to 450°F of heat styling. I also like to use the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Sam Villa Sleekr Iron</a>, this is a must for reds. The flat iron has ceramic plates that are coated with tourmaline, which provides even heat distribution across the plates. This results in extra shine and smoothness, while being gentle on the hair."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-often-to-touch-up-red-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Often to Touch-Up Red Hair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to our experts, how often you’ll need to touch up your color really depends&nbsp;on the type of red you choose. “Some of the softer coppers, red coppers and copper browns have a tendency to last a little longer than vivid bright reds. The best practice is to set up an appointment six weeks after your color to check if the red needs a light refresh," Brown says. "If you have fine, straight hair and shampoo daily, you may need your red touched up more frequently than someone who has medium-density curly hair, and shampoos once or twice a week."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-26-examples-of-red-hair-colors></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>26 Examples of Red Hair Colors</span></h2><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dimensional-copper></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Dimensional Copper</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Amy Adams' look is a beautiful example of the range of copper that works well for a fair skin tone,” says Brown. “I love the bits of brightness, they add dimension and make the overall look pop.

It was so fun and playful to do."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To achieve this, the stylist says to start by sectioning the hair you want to put up into a bun, then clip away the hair that you want to use for the face-framing pieces. "Secure your hair into a ponytail, then apply a styling cream to slick the hair up into your desired bun position. I recommend using <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Dae 3-in Styling Cream</a> to slick back the hair," he says. "Once the hair is in a ponytail, I would take medium-to-small sections of the hair and wrap it around loosely into a bun, securing each piece with a bobby pin as you go. At the end you should have a nice, messy bun. For the face-framing pieces, you can straighten or curl them depending on preference.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-vivid-copper></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Vivid Copper</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Doja Cat's vivid copper pops!
