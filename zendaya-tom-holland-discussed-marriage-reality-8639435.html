"There has been talk of marriage, and that is a reality," a source told the outlet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Should Tomdaya tie the knot, it's unlikely that fans will know right away given how little they discuss their relationship. "They are not the kind of stars who put their lives together out there on social media for the most part," the source explained, later adding that "both are private" and that being in the public eye "has never been easy or comfortable for either of them."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Zendaya and Tom Holland have been the subject of marriage rumors before. Back in 2023, the Euphoria star sent fans into a frenzy when she was posted a photo of herself to her Instagram Story, in which she wore a large ring on her engagement finger. The actress didn’t hesitate to set the record straight, taking to Instagram <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>to debunk the engagement rumors</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I can't post anything, you guys," Zendaya later said in a video. "I posted it for my hat… Like, not for the ring on my right finger, you guys. Seriously, you think that's how I would drop the deuce? Like, what?!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the meantime, Zendaya and Holland are enjoying where they are at.
