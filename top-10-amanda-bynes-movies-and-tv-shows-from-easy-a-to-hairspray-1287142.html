All That is similar to a modern Saturday Night Live, except it is full of teenage acts, including Nick Cannon, Lori Beth Denberg, Gabriel Iglesias, and many more. The show was so successful that stars like Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell were given their own spin-off series.</p><p>Though All That had writers, the cast of comedians were encouraged to improvise as much as possible. A popular sketch on the show was Ask Ashley,&nbsp;where Bynes was featured as someone who gave advice to those who called in while she resides in her bedroom at home. Another well-liked sketch was Good Burger,&nbsp;where Kel Mitchell was featured as a lethargic, low-life cashier at a fast food restaurant.</p><h2><strong>8.&nbsp;Easy A (2010)&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Bynes appears in a supporting role as Marianne Bryant, a devout Christian student who spreads rumors about her classmates' promiscuity.

However, things become complicated when Jenny discovers that they are not alone on the island, and she must compete with another girl (played by Jamie-Lynn Sigler) for Jason's affections.</p><p>With its mix of romance, comedy, and adventure, Love Wrecked&nbsp;takes viewers on a fun and entertaining journey as Jenny learns valuable lessons about love, friendship, and the importance of being true to oneself.</p><h2><strong>10.&nbsp;Robots (2005)</strong></h2><p>From the creators of the Ice Age franchise and dominating the box office upon its release in 2005, this computer-animated sci-fi comedy dazzled audiences.
