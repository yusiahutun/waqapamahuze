STOP!"</p><p>Watch in the video below as he holds his hands on his hips, as if to tell the entire crowd they're in trouble for not letting him in on his wardrobe malfunction.</p><p>Bryan yells into the mic that his "f---ing zipper has been down the whole time."</p><p>He zips up quickly and walks over to a fan in the first few rows to give her a high-five, telling her, "thank you for telling me."</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer alignnone"><p><span class=visually-hidden>Luke Bryan</span></p>Joseph Bengivenga, Youtube<p>loading...</p></figure><p>"Why did none of you a--holess tell me?" he jokingly asks the rest of the crowd.
