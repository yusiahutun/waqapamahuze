In a volatile era where active trading should theoretically trump index investing, here’s how they did it and some of the opportunities they see in the year ahead.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">Dymon Asia Multi-Strategy Investment Fund</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The fund enjoyed a 5.1 per cent gain in 2022, growing its assets under management to US$2.3 billion. The key drivers to returns came from anticipating directional moves in Asian currencies, relative value trades in rates, and volatility trades in equities, said Kenneth Kan, deputy CEO of Dymon Asia Capital.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hedge funds add Chinese stocks as BlackRock cautions market view is too rosy</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For the year ahead, China’s reopening is a theme much of the firm is watching. Chinese “revenge travelling” after the lifting of restrictions could help currencies such as the Thai baht, the Singapore dollar, the Korean won and the euro. Consumption has already started picking up and could accelerate after the Lunar New Year holiday, the fund manager said.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/01/23/Clean-thumb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:54</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Chinese tourists return in droves to Bali, Thai beaches for first time in 3 years</p><p>Chinese tourists return in droves to Bali, Thai beaches for first time in 3 years</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a strong US dollar environment, “one could put on a relative-value FX trade against another country that could see less tourists from China,” Kan said, citing India as an example with comparatively few Chinese arrivals. “In equities, the China reopening trade will benefit travel, hospitality, and luxury stocks in particular.”</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">Modular Asset Management (Singapore)</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Singapore-based manager, helmed by Millennium Management alumnus Jimmy Lim, scored a 14.3 per cent gain without a down month last year, with its assets under management sitting at US$1.1 billion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One trade that did well was a year-long bet through November favouring the Singapore dollar against a basket of currencies of its trading partners. It anticipated the city-state to be the first in the region to exit Covid restrictions, leading to higher trade and tourism flows. A further boost came from the central bank’s move to strengthen the currency to combat inflation, Lim said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Rabbit fortune-reading: Hang Seng’s 30,000 struggle and Taiwan black swan alert</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Modular also envisioned post-Covid reopening would help Malaysia absorb labour displaced from service industries, bringing wage pressure and leading to rising local interest rates. The wager paid off when Malaysians hoarding the greenback led to tighter liquidity and credit conditions, forcing rates up, he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The firm built a position in October that would profit from a rebound of the Japanese yen when it weakened to around 150 per dollar. The company benefited when Japan reopened its borders that month, Lim added. It also had various Japanese government bond wagers, anticipating earlier-than-expected Bank of Japan yield curve control changes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/01/23/Clean-thumb.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Modular started betting in November that China would exit Covid restrictions sooner than the market anticipated, shifting focus to boosting consumption and helping hard-hit industries to stabilise and recover.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This would mean support especially in the property sector and also easing of technology sector constraints,” Lim said. “In this process, liquidity will have to be kept loose or at least not tightened.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He expects the long Chinese bonds and equity trades to continue to work out past the Lunar holidays.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">Asia Genesis Macro Fund</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chua Soon Hock retired from the hedge fund industry for many years before deciding to return with a fund in 2020. His macro fund returned 15.3 per cent in 2022, with assets standing at US$173 million. Much of this was thanks to shorting US stock indices as well as Treasuries. His fund switched the latter to a long position in the third quarter amid rising interest rates.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Biden and Kishida agreed US and Japan must steady China relations: officials</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now, the fund is expecting more uncertainty from geopolitical tensions, supply chain challenges, inflation and interest rate pressure. Asia Genesis plans to trade the Nikkei 225 Index, predominantly on the short side, with two-way swings expected in the market, the firm said in a note to investors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“2023 is likely to have its share of turbulence, where we will witness shorter bull markets with more frequent bear phases,” according to the note. “We can anticipate further weakness in housing and the most rate-sensitive components of consumer spending, before further knock-on effects on income, employment, profitability, and asset prices.”</p>The fund’s other investment ideas include <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">long bets on the Hang Seng Index</span></a> and the Singapore dollar, and tactically shorting the Japanese yen against the US dollar.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtfmLWqusBmma6rmaOytL%2BOmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkWlvcWliZMCqusaap6iqlWKvor%2FEnWShnZScsm6y1KebrGWSmq61ecCsoJplpKq%2FrrvIpWSaqpViubC7yqKloGWTnbavrYyer62dnpl6uLXNp6Cnn12nwq95kWlpbA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
