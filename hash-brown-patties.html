What is done? What is ready? Aren’t we all works in progress, forging paths to even more greatness? Sometimes it’s obvious when a recipe is ready to laminate and tuck in our forever files; I love those days. Sometimes, the longer I leave it, the more it metamorphosizes. What I’m trying to say is that in 2020, this was a tater tot recipe. In 2021, it became a giant tot, i.e. a thick hash brown patty, and also gluten-free. In 2022, because I’m so attached to the Trader Joe’s version stashed in my freezer and wanted these more like that, it became thinner.</p><p><span id=more-60423></span><br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/52849521768_2d603bd449_n.jpg alt="hash brown patties-01" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/52849464275_22dd379a33_n.jpg alt="hash brown patties-02" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/52849464200_55b8303a7c_n.jpg alt="hash brown patties-03" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/52848487127_8ac036de44_n.jpg alt="hash brown patties-04" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/52849522098_903db9b3df_n.jpg alt="hash brown patties-05" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/52849464790_d137c567f1_n.jpg alt="hash brown patties-06" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/52848487637_1c468da54a_n.jpg alt="hash brown patties-07" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/52849522978_29f90e1c9a_n.jpg alt="hash brown patties-10" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The year is now 2023. <a href=#>Books</a> have been published. Regimes have changed. Children have entered and nearly completed middle school, gray hairs have sprung, betraying, and I believe — I mean, I’m absolutely utterly certain — that this is the final iteration of what I consider to be the perfect homemade hash brown patty: crisp, as fuss-free as possible, and my absolutely favorite raft for an egg, or the base of a salad-y lunchtime avocado toast. The only thing I forgot to do is test it in an air-fryer but I’m going to send this off regardless, before we blink and it’s 2024, and trust that someone will report back in the comments below about how it went. Deal?</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/52849465565_ff3b8575d9_z.jpg alt="hash brown patties-12" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/52849252804_d8f0d1b8d9_z.jpg alt="hash brown patties-13" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h5>Fun stuff!</h5><p>* <strong>Signed cookbook:</strong> Want to buy a signed cookbook as a Mother’s Day gift for yourself or someone else?

This recipe is easily scaled up and down, as needed.]<ul><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 pound russet potato(es), peeled, and cut into 1-inch chunks</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>Salt</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 tablespoon potato starch</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>Neutral, high-heat oil for frying</li></ul><strong>Cook your potatoes:</strong> Place potato chunks in a pot of cold, salted water and turn the heat to high. Set your timer for 15 minutes. At the 15-minute mark, even if the water hasn’t boiled for long, check a chunk of potato. We’re looking for it to be tender enough for knife or skewer should go through it but it shouldn’t be mushy; add another minute or two if needed. Drain the potatoes and transfer to a large cutting board. Spread to cool slightly in a single layer, about 5 minutes.<p><strong>Form the hash brown mixture:</strong> Chop the potatoes into small bits, about the size of peas. In a bowl, combine with starch and season to taste — I call for salt but you can add pepper or any other seasonings you like in your hash browns at this point.</p><p><strong>Shape the patties:</strong> Transfer back to the counter and knead in on the cutting board a few times until you can shape it into a big, thick round. Divide it into 4 wedges for the generously-sized patties you see here, or 6 for smaller ones. Use your hands to form each wedge into a round, and then flatten it about 1/2-inch-thick and form shape you want against the board — either a round patty or you can nudge it into more of a rounded rectangle, as I do here. Repeat with remaining wedges.</p><p><strong>Fry the patties:</strong> Heat a medium-sized, heavy frying pan over high heat with enough oil to go most of the way up the sides of the patties. [In my photo, I’ve fully submerged them in oil, i.e. deep-frying them, but shallow-frying will work too.] When the oil reaches 350°F to 360°F, or a crumble of potato immediately sizzles and begins to darkens in the pan, use a thin spatula to transfer the first patty from the board, lowering it slowly in the oil. Fry until medium brown underneath, 1 to 2 minutes, spooning oil over the top of the patty for even color. Carefully turn it over and fry until the second side of the patty is also nicely browned, another 1 to 2 minutes. Lift out of the oil, shaking excess droplets back into the pan, and transfer to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle immediately with salt.</p><p>Repeat with remaining patties. If your pan is big enough, go ahead and fry two at a time. [I use a smaller one so I need less oil.]</p><p><strong>To finish:</strong> Eat right away, as is, or topped with a fried egg or salad-y avocado toast and a soft-cooked egg, as shown above. Leftover patties can be frozen. From the freezer, reheat on a tray in a 400-degree oven for 20 minutes, flipping once. From the fridge, 10 to 15 minutes should be sufficient.</p><p><strong>A few questions, pre-answered:</strong></p><ul><li>The Russet is the best potato choice here; we need its floury lightness to give us that fluffy tot texture and great binding.</li><li>I buy a bag of <a href=#>potato starch</a> approximately once every four years from Bob’s Red Mill. It will not go bad. I use it for <a href=#>latkes</a>, too. It’s also phenomenal on Japanese fried chicken (karaage) but that post for another time. If you do not or do not wish to buy have potato starch, 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour will work, too.</li><li>Frying oil: My favorite for savory shallow- and deep-frying is peanut oil, but of course this will not work for everyone, given how common peanut allergies are. Any neutral, high heat vegetable or canola oil will work here. The bottle you buy will make it clear it works at higher heats for frying [or have a picture of fried chicken on it]; if not, choose a different one.</li><li>Yes, you can reuse your frying oil. I prefer to do this when what I’ve fried has no additional (garlic, onion, or spice) flavors, such as here because it smells neutral later. I made the <a href=#>Easiest French Fries</a> two months ago and strained the leftover oil, removing any crumbs, and poured it back into the bottles it came from once cool. It’s been in the fridge since and I used some here; it was as perfect as the first day. You can also freeze leftover oil.</li><li>No, I haven’t tried this in an air fryer yet but I suspect someone will soon and I’ll point you to these comments as they emerge.</li></ul><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-60423 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-60423 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
