In this one, Ramón plays Will Trent, a character that he quickly found very compelling.</p><p>Let us tell you that the actor/director also appeared in the series including Day Break, The Wire, Charlie’s Angels, Gang Related, Iron Fist, The Defenders, and The Affair; and in the films such as&nbsp;Pride and Glory, The Taking of Pelham 123, Battle: Los Angeles, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Need for Speed, and The One and Only Ivan.</p><h3><strong>Ramón Rodríguez Wife: Is The Actor Married?</strong></h3><p>So, the way Ramón Rodríguez presents himself in the real world is as someone who is single. It at least looked that way to an outsider as of the time of this writing. Either he has done a fantastic job of concealing it, or he has rather kept himself busy just with work. Ramón has also not once been married until now.</p><p>Also, because his dating history also has been pretty private and secretive, there have been no recorded linkups, except for one. Back in 2011, he dated his Charlie’s Angels costar and Minka Kelly, AKA “ex-Esquire Sexiest Woman Alive”.</p><p>Ramón is one of the lucky many the American actress/model dated. Her other famous ex-boyfriends include Brian White, Donald Faison, John Mayer, Josh Radnor, Chris Evans, and a few others. More recently, things seemed to be getting serious between her and Trevor Noah as she reportedly moved into the $27.5M Bel Air house he bought in late 2020.</p><h3><strong>Ramón Rodríguez Family</strong></h3><p>Ramón Rodríguez’s parents are folks from Santurce, Puerto Rico according to&nbsp;thefamilynation.com. His mother is Maria Monserrate Rodriguez Bello and it is she who introduced Ramón to Salsa dancing back in 2001. (He later received training in Salsa from a Latin Dance Company in New York.)</p><p>While Ramón appears to have a close relationship with his mother, he talked about “a very complicated sort of relationship” with his musician father. Back in August 2020, he told Variety that his complicated relationship with his dad has come a long way because of a script that he wrote loosely based on their relationship.</p><p>Ramón&nbsp;has three older sisters and also three younger brothers (who are living in Puerto Rico). He said that this script has “actually” helped him get past a lot of it, “a lot of the trauma”.</p><p>Speaking of siblings, Ramón has six, three older sisters and three younger brothers. Among them is brother Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez, who is a writer, artist, and graphic novelist. Edgardo wrote once on his Facebook that his mother Maria raised his brother Axel and his sister Marisol and himself on her own.</p><h3><strong>Ramón Rodríguez Accent</strong></h3><p>Ramón Rodríguez speaks with a slight, southern accent.</p><p>He describes himself as a New Yorker, Puerto Rican who grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Ramón Rodríguez Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Ramón Rodríguez’s net worth was already recorded as $3 million and plus by October 2014. So, clearly, he should have racked up a couple more million in these past years.</p><p>Ramón never really thought of becoming an actor. It was a mere coincidence that kind of happened through basketball. He used to play the game and even had gotten a scholarship in Michigan at age 14, through it. One day so it happened that he was invited to a Nike competition by a friend where he had to do tricks. He had gone to the competition because they were giving away free sneakers. He ended up winning this tricks competition, and Nike asked him to be a part of their commercials and a bunch of other spots. So, that was him encountering the camera for the first time. He then started doing other roles in TV and films and even took classes for them. With time, he started appreciating the craft and so he also naturally fell in love with it.</p><h3><strong>Ramón Rodríguez Height</strong></h3><p>Ruggedly handsome with tanned skin, and dark eyes Ramón Rodríguez stands 5′ 11″ (1.8 meters) in height.</p><h3><strong>Ramón Rodríguez Education</strong></h3><p>It appears Ramón Rodríguez never received any degree or formal training in Acting.
