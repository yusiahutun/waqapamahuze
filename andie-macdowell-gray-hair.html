In a recent interview, the actor dove deep into why she’s embracing the silver after years of playing with the idea. She also gave us a glimpse into how she’s keeping her mane looking gorgeous.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Stepping Into Her Power</h2><p>Macdowell, 63, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">opened up to Vogue</a> about the pressures she faced as a woman in the industry. Known for her brunette curls, she admits that when she initially started to go gray, the look was harder to embrace. “I suffered in this business as an actress, with people always wanting me to look younger,” she remembered. “For me, it kind of hurts my heart that I can’t embrace where I am because honestly, I feel like I am enough right where I am.”</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>But during the quarantine, the helpful nudge of her childrens’ compliments made MacDowell start to rethink her look. “My hair started growing and every time my kids would see me, they kept telling me I looked badass with my gray hair,” she said. With that, she took to social media and started checking out other <a href=#>celebs who had gone gray</a> (she specifically calls out George Clooney and Jane Fonda) and started to become inspired.</p><p>Finally, MacDowell took the leap despite advice against it from her peers. “I got a job and very quickly I had to make up my mind about what I was going to do. My managers had actually said to me, ‘It’s not time.’ And I said, ‘I think you’re wrong, and I’m going to be more powerful if I embrace where I am right now.'”</p><p>Since then, MacDowell has never looked back. “Once I did it, it was just so clear to me that my instincts were right because I’ve never felt more powerful. I feel more honest. I feel like I’m not pretending. I feel like I’m embracing right where I am. I feel really comfortable. And in a lot of ways, I think it’s more striking on my face. I just feel like it suits me.”</p><p>And she’s right, judging by her latest appearance at this years’ Cannes Film Festival, MacDowell doesn’t need to cover her grays to stop the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/07/andie.jpeg><p>To our surprise, MacDowell says that she’s boosting and <a href=#>maintaining her gray hair</a> with products that are super affordable. “I use a lot of purple conditioners to make it look silver, and it’s amazing how they work. I love L’Oreal’s different purple products,” she said. Specifically, we love this Toning Puple Conditioner from L’Oreal Paris (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Buy on Amazon, $6.72</a>). It’s sulfate-free and the formula cools the tone of gray hair, helping it to appear shinier!</p><p>We’re going to take a word from Andie MacDowell and start embracing the changes that come with getting older. As this silver fox shows, age doesn’t define beauty.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonKeslafBorXNppynrF%2BWu6W1xGakmpuUpMSmuMtmnquZqWK1orXR</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
