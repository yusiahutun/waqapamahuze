They didn’t miss the bus ... but the bus was missing.</p><p>Corey Comeaux, 36, of Kenner, La., was accused of stealing the Jones County School District bus, and he wound up getting another form of public transportation — in the back of a Jones County Sheriff’s Department patrol cruiser — to public housing at the Jones County Adult Detention Center.</p><p>Comeaux (photo in For the Record) was reportedly staying with a friend on McFarland Road when the friend woke up and saw the school bus in his driveway that Saturday morning and called authorities. Deputy Bill Hogue was dispatched to the residence and noted that a window had been broken out of the Jones County school bus.</p><p>Comeaux was on the couch in the living room and admitted to driving it there, according to the report. He told the deputy that he had gone for a walk early that morning, saw the bus and decided to drive it back because he “felt his life was in danger.”</p><p>When the deputy asked why he felt that way, Comeaux said he “worked for the FBI and he was being chased and shot at by some unidentified people,” according to the report.</p><p>The bus had been parked at the home of driver Matthew Palmer on Red Hill Florence Road, less than a mile away. He did not know the bus had been taken at the time he was contacted, according to the report. The bus was released to Jeremy Gentry, who is head of transportation for the school district.</p><p>Comeaux was transported to the jail and booked for grand larceny. He made his initial appearance in Jones County Justice Court on Sunday. Judge Sonny Saul set his bond at $10,000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcK7UrGStnZRkrrPAyJyjnpdnm4R4sJNya2ZvYZmybn2QnpxmcWRrsW6FwZqacp2Uan6kf5Bnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
