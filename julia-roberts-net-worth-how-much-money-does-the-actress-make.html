The Georgia native made her acting debut in a 1987 episode of </span><i><span>Crime Story</span></i><span>.

She met her husband, cinematographer </span><a href=#><b>Danny Moder</b></a><span>, while working on the film </span><i><span>The Mexican</span></i><span> in 2000. They got married two years later and welcomed twins <a href=#>Hazel</a> and <a href=#>Phinnaeus</a> in 2004. Their youngest son, <a href=#>Henry</a>, was born in 2007.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“There are great things I’ve accomplished in my career, and I’d be happy to accomplish more, of course, to impress my children and my husband. But you know what? I’ve been spoilt already,” the</span><a href=#><span> proud mom of three</span></a><span> gushed to</span><a href=#> <i><span>Harper’s Bazaar</span></i></a><span> in October 2017.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Julia admitted that <a href=#>becoming a mother</a> changed the trajectory of her path in Hollywood. The icon confessed she used to be a “selfish little brat” who ran around “making films” for herself. Meeting Danny was a huge turning point for the Golden Globe winner, not only in her personal life but also in her career.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“When I think about what makes my life my life, and make sense and just shine inside of me, it’s him,” she reflected on her marriage. “Everything has come from that for me.”</span></p><p><span>Julia’s Hollywood prowess has not slowed down in recent years. In 2022, she starred in the series </span><i><span>Gaslit</span></i><span> with </span><a href=#><b>Sean Penn</b></a><span> and shared the screen with her longtime pal </span><a href=#><b>George Clooney </b></a><span>in the romantic comedy </span><i><span>Ticket to Paradise</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>How Else Does Julia Roberts Make Money?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>On top of her acting career, Julia runs the production company Red Om Films, responsible for producing </span><i><span>Eat Pray Love</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Maid in Manhattan</span></i><span> and more. She has also been a popular face of the Lancôme brand for more than a decade, frequently appearing in their fragrance ads.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jrKWhkWK%2FsK7Eq6usZZ6awW7DzquroWWYpMRuudScn2aln6OyunnDqJysZaSdsm6twq2pnqujYrqit8Ro</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
