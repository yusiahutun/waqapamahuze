If you're man enough to say it online, why do you need a parody account? You've said it, and that's what you believe, and I have met you here. Come now tell me in person. Come tell me I'm silly, now if you tell me that, you're being a man," he said.<p class=align-left>Mondo revealed that he once met someone who insulted him on X who later approached him to ask for a drink.</p>"I told him I will buy you one if you repeat what you said. I hate the fact that people hide behind the keyboard. You are the same person who will DM me and ask for KSh 10,000 because your house is being closed due to rent. Come say it to me as a man," he added.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/376ced84f957a7b1.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyans Rebuke Man Who Fought Lover Outside Quiver Thika Road for Paying His Friend's Bill</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Watch the video below:</p><h2>Mondo on being pressured to marry</h2><p class=align-left>Elsewhere, Mondo once disclosed on air that his mom wanted him to bring someone home on his fortieth birthday.</p><p class=align-left>The fine on-air personality shared that he <a href=#>kept getting pressure from people</a> who were reminding him that he was turning 40.</p><p class=align-left>His fans empathised with him while some gave their own experiences on how they dealt with the pressure that comes with turning 30 and 40 years old.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZpydnJqvs7XTopysZ2VognKAk2akoqOVYrqwusOoZKGhpKh6r7HTorGepqNisLO106KaoquZo7RuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZpmanV2brqSxjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
