"But I have never...In what world do you imagine that a man would masturbate to his own music?"</p><p>"I think if like if their music was yours?" David replied and then soon realized the question was a little odd.</p><p>"That was just the first one you guys!" she said and Mayer replied "Oh, that was just dipping the toe in the water!"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b06e88e8-7c46-50f6-8b3d-8b4083dbe032 data-container-ref=toofab:article:1f7850a6-1f34-5f40-8a1d-63e82171b928 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/de/5by4/2018/06/04/ded2a5646e0358389de1d228629cb1ac_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Andy Cohen Tells John Mayer Which Star Turned Down 'WWHL' as They Bro Out Over Weed, Sex and Jennifer Lawrence</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>He's Played His Own Music (and Sang!) During Sex Though</h2><p>Although he hasn't masturbated to his own music, Mayer did admit that he's had sex to his hits and even sang some songs before the deed.</p><p>"Has a girl ever asked you to play your music while having sex with you?" David asked.</p><p>"No, but a girl has asked me to sing some of my songs in probably the run up to it," Mayer first said but then backtracked, "I probably did in my early 20s, I probably used my music to hook up a couple times. It doesn't make it any less from the heart."</p><p>"If it's after a show and a girl asks 'Sing Your Body is a Wonderland,'" Mayer added. "Do you want to be the kind of guy who goes, 'No' or do you want to be the kind of guy that goes like, 'We've got the afternoon...?' You want to play along."</p><p>"How many girls have asked you to tell them their 'body is a wonderland?'" David asked. "And can you say it to me after you answer the question?"</p><p>Mayer replied that both men and women alike ask for him to tell them the song lyric from Mayer's 2001 chart topper and yes, he told David that her "body is a wonderland" too.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:195af179-127c-5374-b2eb-b23740b29500 data-container-ref=toofab:article:1f7850a6-1f34-5f40-8a1d-63e82171b928 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=30><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/78/5by4/2018/05/24/7896b050cc3a5709a52f6c71975d3468_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">20 #NewMusicFriday Songs You Gotta Hear: Will Smith, Jennifer Lopez, G-Eazy, Alicia Keys</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>His Sex Number is Much Lower Than You Think</h2><p>For the third sexy question, David asked Mayer to blink if he's slept with over 800 people.</p><p>The "Daughters" singer looked directly into the camera and didn't blink at all.</p><p>"Are you surprised that I've slept with less than 500 people?!" he asked the viewers and then didn't flinch to show the number.</p><p>"By the way, what does it say about my expectations that if you find out that I've slept with less than 500 [people]?" he joked. "You're kind of impressed with me? Like 'He's a good guy.'"</p><p>"[This] might put me into a little bit of a deeper understanding about what it's like to be a woman in that yes I could have sex with somebody at any given moment," he continued. "But I think being a famous man is somewhat similar to be a beautiful woman, which means yes there is access, there's very seldom any desire. The older I get, the less desirous I am about unsheathing new body parts."</p><p>Watch the full Instagram Live in the video below.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
