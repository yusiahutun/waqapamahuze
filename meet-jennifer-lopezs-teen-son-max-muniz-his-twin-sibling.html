While Max tends to keep a low profile compared to the rest of his family, it’s undeniable that the young teen is growing into a handsome young man – and looks more like his father every day.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2015, Lopez described her twins to the Latin Times: “Their personalities are beautiful; they’re like yin and yang. They stay true to who they were from when they were born.” She continued, “Emme is like a mini-me; Max is really like a mini-Marc. They’re complete opposites.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who is the richest woman in the world right now?

Lopez once said in an interview that the pair both loved music and had been taking piano and voice lessons.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, while Emme made their singing debut with mum on the 2020 Super Bowl stage, Max appears to be leaning more towards acting. The teenager made his debut in this year’s film Marry Me opposite his mum.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Waiting for Tonight diva told El Gordo y la Flaca that it was her family who had gently urged Max to take on the small part in the film. “They encouraged him by saying: ‘Do it, do it, you’re going to enjoy it,’” she said, adding: “He had a great time, and he wants to do it more. He wants to be an actor.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This should come as no surprise given that both of his parents have of course themselves starred in a string of films and television shows.
