Michelle</a> is known for being in the center of drama. She tends to attract headlines for her petty antics, gaffes, and feuds with everyone from Tamar Braxton to her former Love & Hip Hop co-star Joseline Hernandez. But this time, she swears she really didn’t mean to start anything.</p><p id=par-2_45><a href=#>The “V.S.O.P.” singer</a> was recently on Instagram Live when she apparently forgot she was recording and began to bad-mouth Memphis rapper Moneybagg Yo. The remarks led to a back-and-forth between them that ended with K. Michelle offering up a quasi-apology to the “U Played” rapper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/K-Michelle-and-Moneybagg-Yo.jpg><h2>What did K. Michelle say about Moneybagg Yo?</h2><p id=par-3_58><a href=#>HotNewHipHop</a> reports the drama started on July 17. K. Michelle had been in the studio on Instagram Live when she joined in on the national conversation about a pricey Lamborghini truck Moneybagg Yo had just bought for his girlfriend, Ariana&nbsp;“Ari” Fletcher. Without any apparent evidence, she claimed the truck was rented and took shots at the rapper’s finances.</p><p id=par-4_55>“I should go up here with Moneybagg and tell him about his&nbsp;$100,000 that they finna show in his bank account today at 7 o’clock while he trying to be picky about some records when I done did sh*t with&nbsp;Chris Brown&nbsp;and everything,” she said, suggesting she had unsuccessfully tried to work with the Memphis artist.</p><p id=par-5_20>“And I turned your a** down for some p***y. And you out here with $100,000 rentin’ Lambos,” K. Michelle added.</p><p id=par-6_11>The clip cut as K. Michelle said, “Oh, I’m on live.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><h2>Moneybagg Yo and Ari Fletcher’s response to K. Michelle</h2><p id=par-7_22>As the Internet started obsessing over K. Michelle’s claims, both MoneyBagg Yo and Ari took to Instagram to respond to her.</p><p id=par-8_29>Ari, a social media influencer, <a href=#>posted a video</a> where she refuted the singer’s claim that the truck is rented while Moneybagg Yo bashed K. Michelle in another clip.</p><p id=par-9_48>“I’m so tired of these mad jealous a** h*es just poppin’ up out the woodwork like, ‘H*e, I don’t even know you,’” he claimed. “Never talked to you, never DM’d you, never text you, never received a call from you, never picked up a call like c’mon bruh.”</p><p id=par-10_25>“Keep it real with yourself first,” he continued. “Then you talking about a feature name dropping. I don’t give a f**k who you worked with.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-11_27>He later clarified after social media users unearthed <a href=#>an old clip of him</a> and K. Michelle that he had met her once but still considered her unimportant.</p><p id=par-12_55>As the pair and other social media users continued to vent about the matter, K. Michelle hopped online and said she’d learned her lesson. “In the words of&nbsp;@iloveshalah&nbsp;‘No more Instagram lives for you miss lady, you forget when you’re even on it’ Lesson learned❤️” she captioned <a href=#>an Instagram picture of her</a> sitting on a sofa.</p><p id=par-13_12>As of writing, it’s the latest update in the drama among them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS5sMLEZp%2BiqF2dvLF50q2Yq2WbYrqqr8eeo6WdXZyytb%2BMoqWtp12Weqex1J1ksKGknXquu82esJuZl5x6uruMmp2tnaJirqSvyJ2cp6yRobm6edKhmJ2hnpx6qbXMZqanZZmjwLWtxquYpmWcnsOmesetpKVn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
