'I said: 'If you ever need a babysitter, like if you're going to Harrods or whatever, then bring them here.' '</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Over the next few months, the women became friends. During that time, says Bridget, Barrett —known as Katrina, Katya or Katty to friends — frequently flaunted her wealth, taking her around town in a chauffeur-driven Bentley and inviting her to her luxurious apartment in Curzon Square in Mayfair.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She says Barrett dropped into conversations that she owned five properties in Monaco worth £100 million. She also took Bridget to visit two further apartments in Grosvenor Square in London's Belgravia which Ekaterina said she planned to buy, despite eye-watering price tags of £25 million each.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Ekaterina never explained where her money came from,' says Bridget. 'But I did believe that she had this huge trust fund she told me about.' She made no mention, of course, of her criminal past in Vienna, where she was arrested after posing as an oil firm agent to con victims into giving her €200,000.</p><img id=i-95b16f14f6f33ec5 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/06/11/21/72013685-12183565-_Ekaterina_is_not_what_she_seems_says_Bridget_Hutchcroft_picture-a-1_1686516355285.jpg height=953 width=634 alt="'Ekaterina is not what she seems,' says Bridget Hutchcroft (pictured) who says she counted Barrett as a friend before lending her vast sums of money ¿ sums which are yet to be returned" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>'Ekaterina is not what she seems,' says Bridget Hutchcroft (pictured) who says she counted Barrett as a friend before lending her vast sums of money — sums which are yet to be returned</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>READ MORE:&nbsp;<a style=font-weight:700 class=class href=#>Knightsbridge boutique boss, 63, who sold designer clothes to Princess Diana hunts 'runaway heiress who conned her out of £1.3million'</a></h3><img id=i-dfcbb13415b31d98 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/06/11/20/71756113-12183565-Bridget_Hutchcroft_63_told_the_Mail_how_she_was_betrayed_by_Ekat-a-71_1686511655880.jpg height=206 width=274 alt="Bridget Hutchcroft, 63, told the Mail how she was betrayed by Ekaterina Barrett (pictured), 67, who befriended her then convinced her she urgently needed to borrow money to see her through a costly divorce" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Bridget Hutchcroft, 63, told the Mail how she was betrayed by Ekaterina Barrett (pictured), 67, who befriended her then convinced her she urgently needed to borrow money to see her through a costly divorce</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/femail/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>A police mugshot of Barrett, looking utterly unlike her usually immaculate self, appeared in a Viennese newspaper.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Back in 2017, Bridget knew none of this. At the time she met Barrett, she wasn't well.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I'd had time off work because I'd had a breakdown,' she says. 'That's not a good time to meet somebody like Ekaterina. She knew I'd been going through a difficult time. I was on quite heavy medication. She homes in and she's very adept at what she does.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to Bridget's High Court claim, it was while at Barrett's swanky Mayfair apartment that the alleged heiress took a phone call and, after she'd hung up, announced that the trustee who managed her Liechtenstein-based trust fund had died. For a short period of time, she said, she wouldn't be able to access her funds.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After asking if the shop owed her any outstanding money from the sale of her items, she begged Bridget for a short-term loan of £7,500.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I agreed to give it to her,' says Bridget. 'She was very persuasive and I felt pressurised and it just never occurred to me that she wouldn't pay it back.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And Bridget told the court that sizeable loan was just the tip of a hefty cash iceberg. She claimed that soon Barrett was asking for half a million to pay top-notch lawyers involved in her ongoing divorce from her British husband.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She just kept asking and asking,' says Bridget. 'She said she didn't have anyone else except me. She was either begging or desperate or hysterical.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bridget says she loaned Barrett a further £540,020, and while she kept asking for the money to be repaid, further loans followed after promises from Barrett that Bridget would get her money back faster if she helped her out again.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She said that the money was tied up in a trust; she kept waving bits of paper at me.

'I called her and said: 'You have got to pay me back, Ekaterina.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The answer she received sent a chill down her spine.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She said: 'The next time you ask I will not pay you for a hundred years.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I was just so upset. Not over the money, strangely, but because I had trusted her, ridiculously so. I just wanted to hide away.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bridget first turned to the courts for help by launching a civil claim in March 2020.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Barrett responded by denying that any of the money she'd received was a loan, claiming that the money from Bridget was paid to her for the sale of luxury items from her couture collection as well as reimbursement for trips to Monaco. She claimed that it was Bridget who still owed her further money.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, in 2021, Barrett signed a settlement, agreeing to pay £1.4 million within 14 days to resolve the case. After she failed to do so, a further court order was issued in October last year, ordering her to pay £1,665,560.59, including legal costs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So what do we know of Ekaterina Eliazarovna Svetikova Barrett?</p><img id=i-2352bfe14e9850f0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/06/11/21/72013757-12183565-While_Barrett_has_been_rubbing_shoulders_with_millionaires_and_c-a-2_1686516355287.jpg height=952 width=634 alt="While Barrett has been rubbing shoulders with millionaires and celebrities ¿ among them Prince Albert of Monaco and actress Sharon Stone ¿ she has also encountered trouble with the law in Austria" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>While Barrett has been rubbing shoulders with millionaires and celebrities — among them Prince Albert of Monaco and actress Sharon Stone — she has also encountered trouble with the law in Austria</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Inquiries by the Mail reveal that she was born in 1956, three years after Stalin's death and during Nikita Khrushchev's time as Russian premier, in what was Voroshilovgrad and is now Luhansk in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The city was seized by pro-Russian separatists in 2014 and annexed by Russia in late 2022.

Bridget once travelled there with Barrett: 'You could see there was no money. And I remember thinking, how come your mother's living like this? She was living a very ordinary life.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Barrett's father Eliazar was born in Novosibirsk, in Siberia, but later moved to Munich with his second wife. There, despite Ekaterina's boasts of his fabulous wealth, one acquaintance recalls having to sleep on the sofa during a visit because his apartment was so small.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Barrett claimed to have a wealthy businessman brother in Moscow and that her Liechtenstein trust fund was set up by her wealthy Russian grandfather.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Some of those who have crossed paths with Barrett have likened her to Anna Sorokin, the Russian-born fraudster who posed as a wealthy German heiress, fleeced New York high society and inspired the hit Netflix series Inventing Anna.</p><img id=i-f18a7637cf57a0a7 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/06/11/20/72013763-12183565-image-a-65_1686511181355.jpg height=951 width=634 alt="Bridget says she loaned Barrett a further £540,020, and while she kept asking for the money to be repaid, further loans followed after promises from Barrett that Bridget would get her money back faster if she helped her out again" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Bridget says she loaned Barrett a further £540,020, and while she kept asking for the money to be repaid, further loans followed after promises from Barrett that Bridget would get her money back faster if she helped her out again</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Among those who make that comparison is her 62-year-old British ex-husband Mitch Barrett, an artist who once worked as a model for the likes of Giorgio Armani and Levi's in the 1990s.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He was a mature student studying film and screenwriting at Bournemouth and Poole College when he first met Barrett in 2000.

He says that Barrett wined and dined him, bought him clothes from Versace and took him to Mayfair casinos such as Les Ambassadeurs as well as private gambling club Aspinalls.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She was incredibly charming, although very arrogant,' he recalls. 'She was very intense and love-bombed me. I was in love with her, but it was a strange kind of love.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I was in a vulnerable place.
