Another snapshot shows a glimpse the ABC Family star's bare booty!</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c2/o/2015/08/12/c2ca7abaf6c35c14a71bbea46a4ef0fa_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>"I was really excited to do something a lot more grown up and show a different side of me," she said of the racy shoot.</p><p>"I look at these photos more as art than a photo shoot, because I've always felt really uncomfortable doing photo shoots. I've never felt like a model or anything. James just let me do my thing and caught me at the right moments." Hale added, "I wanted it to have a shock factor."</p><p>Ready for another big shock? It seems Lucy is ending her stint on "PLL" next year!</p><p>"I'll be done next October with [Pretty Little Liars] forever, which is exciting, but also scary at the same time because it's the next chapter of my life," she told the site. "I'm really looking forward to exploring different and darker roles."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/64/o/2015/08/12/642865eca29a55e4aed3801600ce719f_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The former child star will begin working on a movie this fall, but she couldn't spill any secrets about the project just yet. "There hasn't been a press release, so I can't say the title or anything, but I am doing, like, a really cool indie film in October. That's sort of the direction I want to head in," she said. "It's a little raunchy, so it'll be exciting."</p><p>"Most indie films shoot in 30 days...The fans of the show have sort of grown up with me, so it's a movie they can watch, but we'll push the envelope a little bit on it. It's a movie that's got a lot of heart, and morals, but the language! I get to drop the f-bomb every other line, which will be fun," Lucy revealed. This will be my first lead in a movie, which will be very exciting for me."</p><p>We can't wait to see what she does next!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnZ7j3FmampfocKkxYyhmKWdXaG2r7PEq6CeZaZiuqKzwLOgp51dpbWwwM6sZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
