Irina Shayk wore such a dress to open the show, while Kylie Jenner sat front row in the same look. From some angles, it looks like Jenner is quite literally nuzzling a lion, its mane brushing against her contoured cheeks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Their realism seems to have polarised the internet, with several commenters mistaking the faux heads for real taxidermy. The confusion is intentional; in the show notes for the show, Roseberry wrote: "Mimicry (is that a real lion?) becomes its own form of Surrealism in this collection, such that you’re never quite sure who made the piece you’re looking at — was it nature?"<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not everyone was outraged. Designers and stylists like Adam Selman, Karla Welch and Marc Jacobs called the looks a "triumph", praising Roseberry as a "genius" on Instagram, while over on fashion Twitter, many saw the entire collection as a meticulous display of brilliance.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Highlights from the AW22 couture catwalks" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/hcaw22-2-1657537169.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Considering that many fashion houses in the industry, such as Versace and Gucci, have now vowed to stop using fur, the choice to make dresses that look like safari spoils feels rife for backlash. And even though the lion's head — and the leopard and she-wolf seen on Shalom Harlow and Naomi Campbell on the runway — were faux-taxidermy creations, constructed entirely by hand from manmade materials like foam and resin, the internet wasn't happy. Instagram commenters didn't just ask, "Is that a real lion?" as Roseberry had predicted but also, "Why does it have to look like a real lion?" (Jenner seems to have already known the comments were coming, with an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/CnwVWb4N_wb/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Instagram caption" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Instagram caption</a> that emphasises the "faux" nature of her gown.)</p><p>Roseberry saw them as representing protection, writing on his Instagram that they were designed to "celebrate the glory of nature and guard the woman who wears it". The entire collection was inspired by Dante's Inferno, where the leopard, the lion, and the she-wolf serve as allegories for lust, pride, and avarice.</p><img alt="editorial use only for non editorial use please seek approval from fashion house a model walks the runway during the schiaparelli haute couture spring summer 2023 show as part of paris fashion week on january 23, 2023 in paris, france photo estrop by getty images" title="Schiaparelli : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Haute Couture Spring Summer 2023" width=3045 height=4569 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1674490668.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Estrop</span></p><img alt="editorial use only for non editorial use please seek approval from fashion house a model irina shayk walks the runway during the schiaparelli haute couture spring summer 2023 show as part of paris fashion week on january 23, 2023 in paris, france photo estrop by getty images" title="Schiaparelli : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Haute Couture Spring Summer 2023" width=3045 height=4569 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1674490698.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Estrop</span></p><img alt="editorial use only for non editorial use please seek approval from fashion house a model naomi campbell walks the runway during the schiaparelli haute couture spring summer 2023 show as part of paris fashion week on january 23, 2023 in paris, france photo estrop by getty images" title="Schiaparelli : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Haute Couture Spring Summer 2023" width=3045 height=4569 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1674491910.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Estrop</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Roseberry also wanted to play with the concept of doubt this season, specifically, "the doubt of creation and the doubt of intent. The twinned, sometimes contradictory impulses to please one’s audience and to impress oneself; the ambivalence that is every artist’s constant companion."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There's no doubt he succeeded by challenging himself with new techniques he's already seemed to master. In his Instagram post, where he shared behind-the-scenes process images of the faux-taxidermy, it's evident no detail was spared. You can practically see the tastebuds on the she-wolf's tongue. But his exquisite technique seems to have divided even his diehard fans on Instagram, where Roseberry is a couture darling; many commenters have said the pieces glorify hunting and using animals as trophies, no matter how astonishing the craftsmanship.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The reaction to the show feels as much a take on Dante's Inferno as the clothing, which was perhaps the point all along. Roseberry knew he could be thrown to the wolves of the internet — which is arguably the tenth circle of hell — for this, and appears to be welcoming it, ending his show notes with: "I remember that no ascension to heaven is possible without first a trip to the fires, and the fear that comes with it. Let me embrace it always."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">Schiaparelli Haute Couture 2023</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="schiaparelli spring couture 2023" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/schiaparelli-hcss23-01-1674509472.jpg title="schiaparelli spring couture 2023" width=2732 height=4098 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmTAqbvWrGStqpWjsbR7wG1pb2tgaIV5e9Kcn6KZoJa%2FprjLomSpmaKewG6vzq6rrqqVYri6uMieZKOdnqOys3nLoqanZZSnsrS%2FxKxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
