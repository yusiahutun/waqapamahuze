But this has been very, very, very hard, and very difficult, and confusing in many ways," Majors explained. "But I'm standing."</p><p>He told Davis that due to his DV case he hasn't seen his daughter. However, one person in particular has stood by him, "Everything has kinda gone away.

"She’s held me down like a Coretta, I’m so blessed to have her. The relationship is still fresh you know, but I think I found her."</p><p>In the same interview Majors defended audio that was released showing him appearing to lecture Jabbari, insisting she emulate <a href=#><strong>Michelle Obama</strong></a> and <strong>Coretta Scott King</strong> in order to be in a relationship with him. He told GMA he was simply gesturing to cultural giants he aspired to be like.</p><p>In that context, Majors comparing Good to Coretta seemed to be very telling.</p><p>A legal representative for Jabbari, Brittany Henderson, said of Majors' interview: "His denigration of our jury system is not dissimilar from the above-the-law attitude that he has maintained throughout this legal process. The timing of these new statements demonstrates a clear lack of remorse for the actions for which he was found guilty and should make the sentencing decisions fairly easy for the Court."</p><p>Majors was found guilty of two charges in the case, in a split verdict last month: misdemeanor assault in the third degree, and recklessly causing physical injury as well as harassment in the second degree (a violation).</p><p>Prior to the guilty verdict, Majors was tasked with ushering in the next phase of the <a href=#><strong>Marvel Cinematic Universe</strong></a> as new big bad Kang the Conqueror. The role was not simply a villain, but the lynchpin for a multiversal saga spanning multiple blockbuster franchises.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath Marvel Studios/Disney cut Majors from all future projects, sending an-already struggling MCU into limbo.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5209547f-dc6d-4192-b933-eacdd896d48e data-container-ref=toofab:article:1af3e486-4c94-4215-a1ea-efac43c295d4 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c4/5by4/2023/07/31/c4feebfc3269441296dd90b64f83811e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Disney+</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jonathan Majors Featured in Loki Season 2 Trailer, Ke Huy Quan's MCU Debut</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pmaXBfn7yvrdOhmKdlnZa3sL7SZp6op5RiurC%2BzaKloGWRorKztcKaZKKmpJq%2Ft7XEsGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
