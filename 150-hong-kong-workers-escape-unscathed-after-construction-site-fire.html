No casualties have been reported.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was upgraded to a No 3 alarm fire at 2.44pm and then again at 9.31pm to a No 4 alarm. In Hong Kong, fires are rated on a scale of one to five according to their seriousness.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fire services acting divisional officer Hui Kwong-ho said the site was large, measuring 70 metres by 80 metres, and contained a significant quantity of construction materials, which along with very high temperatures posed extra challenges for firefighters.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The temperature at the fire was nearly 500 degrees Celsius, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There was also a large number of oxyacetylene cylinders, which increased the intensity of the flames and prompted the deployment of a firefighting robot to minimise the risks faced by personnel, Hui said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The department had also dispatched drones to conduct high-altitude fire inspections.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">27 people rescued after fire breaks out on small island near Hong Kong’s Lamma</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Currently, firefighters can only spray water from the periphery.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The cause of the fire was still under investigation, Hui said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung Yan-kin visited the scene on Tuesday night. Asked about the possibility of further upgrading the blaze to a No 5 alarm – the highest – he said the current level was sufficient.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yeung said firefighters had not yet reached the basement, which remained inaccessible. He added that the tower cranes would be closely monitored.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He reported that explosions had occurred in the basement earlier in the day, possibly due to the oxyacetylene cylinders on site.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/09/1ea2be99-74d5-4fcb-893e-f50628d5960e_fe822e91.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Earlier, police said the fire might have started when workers used a machine to cut metal on the ground floor, with sparks allegedly igniting construction materials.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hui said two 50-metre-tall tower cranes were at risk of collapsing, but there was no immediate danger.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The Fire Services Department and other departments will continuously assess the latest conditions of the cranes and take relevant measures if necessary,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And he estimated their efforts would need to be sustained for a period of time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/09/1a1923ad-ad95-43ae-b2ed-0b2909ff3f01_b01e97f9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As of 7.30pm, 266 firefighters and 11 paramedics had been mobilised, along with seven water jets, two breathing apparatus teams, 51 trucks and four ambulances.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nearby residents were advised to close their doors and windows and stay calm.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The site is for a Housing Society dedicated rehousing estate at Phase 2 of the Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen New Development Area. The scheme was expected to be completed in 2026, providing 962 subsidised flats for sale.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A society spokeswoman said the fire broke out in the basement of the site, and the contractor promptly evacuated all the workers. The society was helping relevant government departments in their investigation and follow-up actions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Post has learned that the contractor is Paul Y.
