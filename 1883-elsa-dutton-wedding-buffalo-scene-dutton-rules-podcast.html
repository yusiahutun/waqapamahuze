During this episode&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href=#>Dutton Rules: A Yellowstone 1883 Podcast</a>, hosts Adison Haager and Billy Dukes find themselves in her and wonder aloud if we don't already know how this ends for the young dreamer.</p><p>The <a href=#>newest episode of 1883 </a>also&nbsp;leaves&nbsp;behind two enormous Easter eggs in the way of a tribute to <a href=#>Yellowstone</a>, creator Taylor Sheridan's first Western drama. The action focuses on Elsa and Sam (played by Martin Sensmeier) and their blossoming love for one another. It was a character building episode more than one with edge-of-the-seat action, which was necessary after the tornado and bandit attacks from <a href=#>Ep. 7</a>.</p><p>This isn't to say there was no gunfire. The young couple go hunting and she kills a buffalo before learning about a tradition that's unlike any from where she came from. Right before the Q&A, learn about some breaking Yellowstone news with unknown implications for a bunkhouse favorite.</p><p>Click play to listen, or, if you would rather listen later, find&nbsp;Dutton Rules&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=#>Apple Podcasts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Spotify</a>&nbsp;and look for archive interviews with 1883 stars like Elliott,&nbsp;<a href=#>Tim McGraw</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Faith Hill,</a>&nbsp;plus&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;stars like Cole Hauser.
