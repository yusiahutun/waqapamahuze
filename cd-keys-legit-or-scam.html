It sells codes to unlock games from marketplaces like Steam, Origin, and the PlayStation Network, but often at significantly discounted prices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sometimes, games on CDKeys are so cheap that they seem too good to be true. So, is it all just one big scam, or is CDKeys legit?</p><p>We looked into how exactly CDKeys operates, and what its customer say about the service. In addition, we ordered a game ourselves just to see how it works.</p><h2 id=why-is-cdkeys-so-cheap>Why Is CDKeys So Cheap?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CDKeys-FAQ.png><p>In the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ</a> on the CDKeys website, we found the following statement about why the firm’s products are so cheap:</p><p>We buy from all corners of the globe to ensure the cheapest possible prices and as we only sell products in digital form we're able to make significant savings on postage and related expenses—we then pass these reductions on to you, which ensures our pricing is the most competitive around!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Firstly, globes don’t have corners, do they? Secondly, this is pretty vague. It doesn’t explicitly say where CDKeys gets its codes from, only that it buys them cheaply and then resells them on its site.</p><p>We can make some educated guesses, though. One likely explanation is that CDKeys shops around, legitimately buys games from regions where they’re the cheapest, and then resells them to customers.</p><p>That, of course, relies on the codes not being region-locked. Indeed, some games on CDKeys are for specific parts of the world,&nbsp;so how are they offered cheaper than other stores?</p><p>We're speculating here, but it's&nbsp;possible that CDKeys also buys games in bulk when they’re on sale&nbsp;and then adds a markup later when the prices return to normal. This is certainly something that <a href=#>other videogame key sellers</a> do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/browse-cdkeys.png><p>The savings it makes by no having physical stores play a part, but CDKeys frequently undercuts digital stores as well. But whereas services like Steam and Origin&nbsp;host the download files themselves, that's not an expense that applies to CDKeys.</p><p>What do we know about the people behind CDKeys?&nbsp;Its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">terms and conditions</a> page offers some clues. It’s run by Sensible Digital B.V., a company based in the Netherlands.</p><p>Its parent company, Omnyex Ecommerce DMCC is, however, headquartered in Dubai. Notably, Omnyex had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a stand at the E3 expo</a> in 2016, which doesn’t seem like the kind of thing a shady backstreet operation would do.</p><h2 id=what-do-customers-say-about-cdkeys>What Do Customers Say About CDKeys?</h2><p>CDKeys proudly displays its 4.7-star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trustpilot</a> rating on its site. That's encouraging because Trustpilot is one of the <a href=#>best customer feedback sites</a> around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>CDKeys currently has over&nbsp;68,000 mostly positive reviews, and at the time of writing, 87 percent of users rated CDKeys as "Excellent." The service is praised time and time again for its low prices and fast delivery of codes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CDKeys-on-Trustpilot.png><p>At the other end of the scale,&nbsp;7 percent of CDKeys’ Trustpilot ratings are "Bad,"&nbsp;the worst possible rating on the site. Scrolling through those reviews, there are a lot of complaints about codes not working or not being delivered. To date, CDKeys has only replied to 8 percent of those negative reviews.</p><p>Although not insignificant, this relatively low percentage of bad reviews could easily be due to&nbsp;isolated technical problems and customer service issues, rather than having anything to do with the legitimacy of the site.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>CDKeys has very few scores between Excellent and Bad, but this&nbsp;high contrast&nbsp;is typical of user reviews. Whether they like or dislike something, people tend to leave extreme scores—either the maximum or the lowest possible.</p><p>And customers who have a problem which is later remedied aren’t obliged to remove their negative reviews. It’s also true that unhappy customers are more likely to leave a review than happy ones.</p><p>It’s no coincidence that many of CDKeys’ Trustpilot positive scores are from customers who were invited to leave a review. CDKeys pays to access extra Trustpilot features, some of which are integrated with its website. Prompting people to give feedback increases the likelihood that satisfied customers will do so.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Best Gaming News Sites and Game Review Sites</a>&nbsp;</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On other user review sites, like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Reviews.io</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sitejabber</a>, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ResellerRatings</a>, reviews for CDKeys are almost entirely negative, and its overall ratings are no higher than two stars. This sounds bad, but&nbsp;this only confirms the notion that happy customers don’t usually leave reviews unless invited. Furthermore, these other review sites have at most a couple of hundred reviews.</p><p>As with any user reviews, you shouldn't blindly accept CDKeys’ Trustpilot score, but it's a strong indication that the vast majority of its customers come away satisfied.</p><h2></h2><h2 id=our-experience-buying-a-game-from-cdkeys>Our Experience Buying a Game From CDKeys</h2><p>To demonstrate, we’re going to run through all the steps of buying a game from CDKeys, right up to payment and delivery.</p><p>To start, browse or search the CDKeys store to find the game you want. We chose to buy a code for For the King on PC, redeemable via Steam. According to CDKeys, the price of&nbsp;$2.69&nbsp;is 87% cheaper than Steam. We checked, and For the King was, indeed, $19.99 on Steam.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/for-the-king-on-cdKeys.png><p>Once you’ve found the game you want, click <strong>Buy Now</strong> to pay with a card, or click the <strong>PayPal</strong> button. We opted to use PayPal, but if you do pay with a card, make sure your purchase is protected by your card company.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cdkeys-order-done.png><p>Before confirming your order, you’ll get another chance to review your order to make sure it’s all okay. While you’re there, double-check that you have the right version of the game for your region. If you buy a key for a different part of the world, it may not work. Click <strong>Complete order</strong> to finalize your purchase.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the next screen, select&nbsp;<strong>Get your key</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cdkeys-order-complete.png><p>This will take you to the part of your online account where you can see the game you’ve just bought, as well as any others you’ve purchased. Click <strong>Get code</strong> to expand the box and view your download code.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cdkeys-game-code-shown.png><p>Copy and paste, or type this code wherever it needs to go. In our case, we went into Steam and selected <strong>Games > Activate a Product</strong>&nbsp;from the menu. We entered the code, and it all went through with no problems.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/steam-product-activation-successful.png><p>Less than a minute after the order was initially made, we also had confirmation from CDKeys and a PayPal receipt in our email inbox.</p><h2 id=the-verdict-is-cdkeys-safe-to-use>The Verdict: Is CDKeys Safe to Use?</h2><p>Based on our test and the majority of the reviews, CDKeys seems to be a mostly reliable and legal way of buying cheap games. From personal experience of buying from CDKeys in the past, however, we can confirm the experience isn’t always this smooth.</p><p>We’ve received all the games we’ve ever ordered, but a couple of times, it has taken several hours for keys to arrive. Notably, these were new releases, so it’s possible that CDKeys oversold its stock of keys on those occasions or there was some other technical issue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As with any gray market seller, there is some risk associated with buying from CDKeys. Its customer service may not meet the standards of major outlets, and it might take longer to receive a refund if you have a problem redeeming your keys.</p><p>And if&nbsp;you have problems with a game you buy, rather than the key, you&nbsp;might not get any help from CDKeys either. Its terms and conditions explicitly state it is an intermediary between you and game companies.</p><p>It’s also possible that game companies could decide to clamp down on cross-region selling, invalidating your keys at the same time. CDKeys has already been around for several years, and it would be a PR nightmare, so it doesn't seem likely.</p><h2 id=use-caution-when-shopping-on-cdkeys>Use Caution When Shopping on CDKeys</h2><p>Ultimately, it’s up to you whether or not you want to try CDkeys. A lot is unknown about how it works, so while we can report on our own experience, we can't endorse the company or its practices. And if you would rather not buy from gray market sellers, there are plenty of other reliable sites that offer discounted games.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGianWWbmsa0ecuenqKsXaS%2Fbr%2FCmqRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
