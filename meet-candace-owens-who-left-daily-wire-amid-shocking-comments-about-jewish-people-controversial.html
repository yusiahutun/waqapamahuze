Israel then launched an attack on Gaza, killing more than 30,000 people to date, per The Guardian.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After Israel’s counter-attack last year, Owens criticised its military actions, writing on social media, “No government anywhere has a right to commit a genocide, ever. There is no justification for a genocide.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Meet Letitia James, the New York attorney general who sued Donald Trump</span></p></a></h3>Her statements were met with backlash, with some calling her comments antisemitic – an apparently common criticism from certain sectors towards anyone <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">who makes negative comments about Israel</span></a>’s military response.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, on an episode of her show on The Daily Wire, she went even further, speaking about the possibility of a “sinister Jewish gang” in Hollywood, per Media Matters. She also drew sharp criticism for liking a post on X (formerly Twitter) that accused well-known Rabbi Shmuley Boteach of being “drunk on Christian blood”, per The Guardian. That comment is particularly harmful as it evokes the “blood libel” conspiracy – the false claim that Jews use the blood of non-Jews for ritual purposes – which was used by Nazis to defend the persecution of Jews, per the Holocaust Encyclopaedia.</p>Owens also defended <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Kanye West amid his antisemitic comments</span></a> in 2022 when he posted on social media that he was “going death con 3 on Jewish people … you guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone who opposes your agenda”. Owens claimed the comments were not, in fact, antisemitic and that Ye saying “defcon” was not a threat or reference to the Holocaust, per Newsweek.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She even attracted the attention of Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes, per Forbes, who praised her for a “full-fledged war against the Jews”. Owens retorted on X that she did not know him and thinks that “my crime is having stood up for myself against your [netizens’] network of smears”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who is billionaire mogul Rupert Murdoch’s fifth wife-to-be, Elena Zhukova?</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">So what happened between Candace Owens and Ben Shapiro?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/27/76954d26-6c61-470b-9dec-2d71f564b6b7_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shapiro, who is the co-founder of The Daily Wire and a Jewish-American, has had several public spats with Owens, according to The Guardian.
