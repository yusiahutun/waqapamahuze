Telegram channels allow you to connect with people to talk about any topic you're interested in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let's take a look at the best Telegram channels you should know about. With so many to sort through, we'll cut through the junk to show you some of the top picks for Telegram channels.</p><h2 id=telegram-channels-vs-telegram-groups>Telegram Channels vs. Telegram Groups</h2><p>Before looking at the best Telegram channels, it's important to know <a href=#>the difference between Telegram channels and Telegram groups</a>. While they're similar, they have some distinctions.</p><p><strong>Telegram groups</strong> are multi-person chats. While they're suitable for groups of friends or small teams, Telegram also supports groups of up to 200,000 members. In a group, you can assign admins with granular permissions, decide whether new members can see old messages when they join, and pin important messages to the top.</p><p><strong>Telegram channels</strong> allow you (and a team of admins if you wish) to broadcast messages to an unlimited amount of subscribers, who cannot send their own messages. In these, the channel's name, not your account, shows up next to messages. Channels also include a view counter so you can keep track of how many people have read your message.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Telegram-Channel-Message-Example.png><p>Telegram channels can be public or private. Anyone can find a public channel by searching on Telegram, but you can only get into private channels through an invite or link.</p><p>Essentially, Telegram groups allow some number of people to talk together, while Telegram channels allow a small number of people to broadcast messages to many subscribers. We'll focus on a list of the best Telegram channels here; the best groups are harder to define for a broad audience.</p><h2 id=the-best-telegram-channels-worth-joining>The Best Telegram Channels Worth Joining</h2><p>Let's look at some great Telegram channels you should check out.
