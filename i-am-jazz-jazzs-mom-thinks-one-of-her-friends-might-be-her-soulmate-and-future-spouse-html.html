Noelle’s surgeon, Dr. Bowers, was also one of Jazz’s surgeons (alongside Dr. Jess Ting), so it was the perfect opportunity for Jazz to offer Noelle some emotional support and get a checkup from Dr. Bowers at the same time.</p><p id=par-5_14>During <a href=#>Noelle’s pre-surgery appointment</a>, Dr. Bowers began to ask her about her personal life.</p><p id=par-6_102>“Do you have a sweetheart right now?” the surgeon asked. The I Am Jazz guest star blushed as she answered, “No.” When Dr. Bowers asked Noelle about her sexual orientation, the teen replied that she was bisexual.</p><p>Noelle’s mom chimed in gleefully, “I want these two to get together,” pointing to Jazz and Noelle. The teen girls looked sheepish as they laughed about their moms’ suggestion.</p><p>“I think they’re gonna get married!” Jeanette agreed.</p><p>Noelle told TLC producers that her mom had never suggested this to her before. “This is the first I’m hearing about this,” she said awkwardly.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><h2>The ‘I Am Jazz’ star’s mom thought she was perfectly ‘compatible’ with her longtime friend</h2><p id=par-7_34>Jazz’s mom told TLC producers that she was serious in thinking Noelle and her daughter might be a great match, especially since both of them were open to be with anyone, regardless of gender.</p><p id=par-8_31>“I think the girls are really compatible in many ways,” Jeanette told TLC producers with Jazz beside her. “And you challenge each other in other ways,” she told her daughter.</p><p id=par-9_41>The <a href=#>I Am Jazz star</a> continued to champion the idea to her blushing daughter. “I don’t know if there’s attraction or what, or if you care about that because you’re pansexual,” Jeanette told Jazz. “But her soul and your soul!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><h2>Jazz and Noelle denied that they had anything more than a friendship</h2><p id=par-10_31>While <a href=#>Jazz and her longtime friend</a> agreed that they clicked and had a deep emotional connection, both agreed that they didn’t think their moms were right about their romantic future.</p><p id=par-11_52>“I think Noelle and I have a really wonderful friendship,” Jazz laughed. “I don’t think it’s gonna go beyond that.”</p><p>Noelle agreed, telling I Am Jazz producers, “I think Jazz and I are really good friends.” She joked, “I don’t think we are the soulmates our parents apparently wish us to be.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS2bq3MZqGasqpit6LG2axkpqedYsGptc2kqmannpp6sLKMoZyrZZantqa6w6xkpqGXncFursRmn56qXai8trjMmqueZZGjsW6y1K2sq51dqL2wwdKeZaGsnaF8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
