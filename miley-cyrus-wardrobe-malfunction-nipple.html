The “Slide Away” singer, 27, took to her Instagram on Wednesday, February 13, to share a series of photos of her in New York City. The pictures showed Miley in a low-cut top as she arrived at the Bowery Hotel after she walked in Marc Jacobs’ show for New York Fashion Week.</p><p>In her caption, the former Disney Channel star told her followers to “swipe right” for a surprise that Instagram will most likely delete. That <a href=# rel=noopener>surprise was her nip slip</a>. “Swipe right . But hurry. Instagram will definitely be removing this post soon,” Cyrus wrote. As of publication time, her Instagram post is still live, as it should be—because <a href=# rel=noopener>nipples are natural</a>, people.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/miley-cyrus-tish-noah-dating-drama.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/miley-cyrus-billy-ray.png><p>After her post, fans took to the Hannah Montana alum’s comments to call on Instagram to allow her to #<a href=# rel=noopener>freethenipple</a>. “#freethenipple I love u @mileycyrus GET IT BABY 🔥,” one fan wrote. Another added, “u served so much today, I’m so proud of u ❤ #FeeeTheNipple.” One more wrote, “Instagram #frethenipple.”</p><p>The “Malibu” singer’s nip slip came on the same day she made her runway debut at Marc Jacobs’ fall/winter runway show in New York City. The Miley, who was a surprise, closed out the show as she walked in a black bra top and wide-leg pants. Her look was complemented with long black gloves and a zebra print bag.</p><p>Of course, to Miley fans, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that she posted her wardrobe malfunction on Instagram. As she explained to W magazine in 2014, she’s <a href=# rel=noopener>much more comfortable naked</a> given her childhood in Tennessee.</p><p>“We never were inside, and we never wore shoes,” she said. “I think it’s why I like wearing no clothes so much and I’m always naked.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9j3FscW9kZLqquMSyZJyxoqrAbsPAq5urp5Kaeq6ty5%2Bsp5uknryvec2ip6mklWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
