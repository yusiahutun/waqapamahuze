His mother is known as the Goddess of Pop, while his father (who passed away on May 27, 2017, from cancer) is the founding member of the Allman Brothers band. Unfortunately, his parents divorced in 1979.</p><p class=align-left>Because of their divorce and his parents pursuing other relationships, Elijah Blue Allman has five half-siblings. He has one half-brother, Chaz Bono, from his mother's side and four half-siblings from his father's side. These are Devon Allman, Delilah, Michael and Layla Allman.</p><p class=align-left>Elijah attended the Hyde School in Bath, Maine, graduating in 1994. There is nothing much known about his formative years aside from the fact that he was exposed to music from an early age because of the parties hosted by his parents. However, he couldn't take full advantage of the opportunities since he was young.</p><h2>Elijah’s relationship with his mother</h2><p class=align-left>Does Elijah Blue Allman have a relationship with Cher? During an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with ET</a> about his past, Elijah opened up about his relationship with his mother and his stepbrother Chaz Bono.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/116c74ae49a7fa1d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nadji Jeter: girlfriend, family, nationality, awards, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He stated that he felt shunned by his parents during his formative years:</p>When you go to boarding school at 7 years old, it’s kind of hard to feel like you’re not being shunned. But I’m at an age where I’m making peace with it because you just have to. But still…it doesn’t mean it’s right. It’s still wrong to do that.<p class=align-left>During the interview, Elijah stated that he would often spend his time during the holidays in Harlem getting into a lot of trouble, even buying drugs at a tender age.</p><p class=align-left>In 2019, Elijah also stated that he had not spoken to his mother in months. They did not even spend <a href=#>Christmas</a> together the previous year. Also, Cher, Elijah's mother, did not congratulate him on his engagement and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">disapproved of his marriage</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Elijah had eloped with Marieangela King after his mother disliked the engagement. Therefore, it was not a huge surprise when Cher was not invited to his son's wedding.

Elijah opened about his relationship with his stepsibling, Chaz. He stated that they were initially close but grew apart as the years went by. They started getting distant when Chaz went to a performing arts learning institution back east, quite far from where Elijah was.
