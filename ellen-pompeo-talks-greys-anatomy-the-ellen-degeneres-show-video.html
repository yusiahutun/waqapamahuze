"And everybody thought because Patrick was leaving that it wouldn't do well, but it's doing very well."</p><p>"It's amazing how much you get done without a penis," Pompeo, who plays Meredith Grey on the show, jokes. "We miss him dearly, but yeah the show is doing very well."</p><p>Though there's been rumors that this will be the last season of <strong>Shonda Rhimes'</strong> ABC medical drama, Pompeo says the hearsay is just not true.</p><p>"No, it's not the last season," Ellen confirms. "I think a lot of people were really upset about his departure, which is super understandable. But I think the change is part of the reason why the show goes on so long. I think people tune in to see what the show looks like now. What is Meredith going to do without Derek. I think they get so upset about the change, but change is precisely what everyone always needs to sort of get to the next place."</p><p>What do you think about the 46-year-old's candid comments?
