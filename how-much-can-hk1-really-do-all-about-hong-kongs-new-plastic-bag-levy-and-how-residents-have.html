According to the survey, more than half of the interviewees agreed to raising the fee to at least HK$2, so it will be more effective reducing single-plastic use. Forty-one percent even said HK$5 would be acceptable. In News, one citizen said he wouldn’t feel affected by the levy unless it was increased to HK$10. According to the SoCO deputy director in News, many low-income families already use non-woven bags, so if the government continues providing these eco-friendly totes to those in need, the fee can be raised further to have a stronger impact on higher-income groups without affecting poorer people too much. Ultimately, this will help reduce the roughly 2,500 tonnes of plastic waste produced in Hong Kong every day and create a more sustainable future for the city.
