In brain chemistry, caffeine binds to the adenosine receptors in the brain. Usually, when adenosine binds to these receptors, it signals the body to start going into a rest state, but when caffeine binds, it blocks adenosine from binding, with the result that the body doesn't wind down: you stay awake and don't become drowsy and tired.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When you drink coffee regularly, the body adapts by creating an artificial abundance of adenosine receptors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Your body becomes tolerant, actually needing coffee just to get you back to feeling normal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sprayable Energy aims to end the cycle by delivering the optimum amount of caffeine directly into the bloodstream (made possible by caffeine's unique molecular structure that allows it to penetrate the skin).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Molecular biology undergraduate Ben Yu came up with the idea while studying at Harvard. He then worked with his father (fortunately a PhD in chemistry and an expert in transdermal technology) to create Sprayable Energy, which was unveiled last year. The claimed benefit? No tolerance, no addiction and no unpleasant withdrawal effects.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2014/09/29/8ea8c6da621d187d7212abcde2ceb7be.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So, does all that science mean it works? Freshly back from a holiday, jetlagged and with mounting deadlines, I needed a coffee IV rather than just a single cup. Perfect time to try the spray.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I twisted the perfume-like pack and had a few sprays. Then, I admit, I was so tired I forgot about it, until 20 minutes later when I noticed I had perked up. The result was subtle; there wasn't an abundance of added energy. I felt lighter, like the load of fatigue had been lifted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I was able to knock over some pressing tasks. After lunch, encouraged by the instructions that multiple doses are OK, a few extra sprays kept me alert through the afternoon (though, admittedly, I was still tired).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Before dinner with friends, another boost from the spray allowed me to carry on. When I finally rolled into bed, I fell straight asleep.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The product does what it claims. I've since used it before exercise for a boost, during long days when I haven't had enough sleep, or while travelling to counteract jetlag.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But it won't replace my morning cup of coffee. A spray of caffeine, for me, doesn't come close to the warm, fuzzy feeling I get from inhaling the smell of a fresh brew. But as a temporary caffeine fix, it hits the spot.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Each black aluminium bottle contains 40 doses (160 sprays), a two-week supply. It costs US$30.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Spraying power: a caffeine shot at your fingertips</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2iZoqm2pLjEaGhvaGNugXp70qmpmrGRl7mmecKanZ%2BdmaOybrvFn5yrq12XwrvGjLCgraCfqsFur9GaqqE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
