Alicia married her husband, Swizz Beatz, in 2010. They share two children together: sons Egypt, born in 2010, and Genesis, born in 2014. Before her marriage to Swizz, Alicia was in a longterm public relationship with her collaborator and producer, Kerry Brothers Jr. They split in 2008.</p><p>Swizz, who was friends with <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/fashion/celebrity-looks/175215/alicia-keys-favotite-fashion-designers/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Alicia for years</a> before they started dating, has been a longtime supporter of his wife, including at the 2024 <a href=# id=auto-tag_super-bowl data-tag=super-bowl>Super Bowl</a>, where she performed her songs “Ain’t Got You” and “My Boo” with <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/music/1717660/usher-super-bowl-performance/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Halftime Show performer, Usher</a>.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/usher-tameka-1.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/alicia-keys-super-bowl.jpg><p>After the performance, many viewers took to X (previously known as Twitter) to comment on <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/usher-super-bowl-guests/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Usher and Alicia’s closeness</a>. “Swizz Beatz watching <a href=# id=auto-tag_usher data-tag=usher>Usher</a> dance with <a href=# id=auto-tag_alicia-keys data-tag=alicia-keys>Alicia Keys</a>,” a user wrote.

Well, after the Halftime Show, Swizz took to his Instagram Story to share several photos of Alicia from her performance. The photos saw Alicia standing in the bleachers and on the field in a red sparkly jumpsuit with a long red cape. At the time of the Super Bowl, Swizz’s posts only included photos Alicia and not Usher.</p><p>Swizz later shared a photo of Alicia and Usher on his Instagram feed, though he didn’t tag Usher. The photo, which was included in an Instagram slideshow of other pictures of Alicia’s Super Bowl performance, showed Usher with his arms around Alicia. Swizz seemed to nod to the discussion around Alicia and Usher’s Super Bowl performance in the caption. “Y’all talking about the wrong damn thing !!! y’all don’t see that amazing dress covering the entire stadium ⚡️🚨😂😂😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨 Tonight’s performance was nothing but amazing with 2 amazing Giants ! Congrats @usher and my love @aliciakeys that song is a classic 🤍 We don’t do negative vibes on this side we make history ✌🏽 Go see GIANTS at @brooklynmuseum it’s open until July blessings 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽,” he wrote.</p><p>Many of Swizz’s followers commended him for his understanding of Alicia and Usher’s performance. “u a better man then me cuz i woulda break the damn TV,” one user wrote. Another commented, “It’s no different from when u see actors on screen it’s just a performance it was strategic and it worked clearly lol the internet runnin wild with it.”</p><p>Swizz also confirmed he and his sons with Alicia were in the audience during Alicia’s Halftime Show performance with Usher in other Instagram Stories, which showed him and his kids in the stands watching the game.

Alicia and Swizz—who have known each other since they were teenagers—started dating soon after Swizz’s split from his first wife, Mashonda Tifrere, whom he filed for divorce from in May 2010. (Swizz and Mashonda married in 2004 and share one child, a son named Kasseem Dean Jr., who was born in December 2006. Swizz also has a son named Prince Nasir Dior from his relationship with ex Nicole Levy, as well as a daughter named Nicole with ex Jahna Sebastian.)</p><p>Alicia and Swizz announced their engagement and that they were expecting their first child in May 2010. They married on July 31, 2010, in a private wedding in Corsica in the Mediterranean Sea. They welcomed their first child, a son named Egypt Daoud Dean, in October 2010. Their second son, Genesis Ali Dean, was born in 2014.</p><p>In an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://people.com/music/alicia-keys-secret-happy-marriage-swizz-beatz/>The Wall Street Journal</a> in 2023, Alicia opened up about the secret to her and Swizz’s happy marriage. “Really carving out the time for each other,” she said. “We all struggle with it. There’s so much to balance. There’s so much to do. And you find yourself running and doing the things for school, for the kids, and doing all the things for your lists, for all the dreams you have in your career, and what you have to do next.”</p><p>She continued, “That time together with you and your partner is so priceless. And to carve out that time and to make that important, as important as those daily things, I think it really pours back into the relationship… You remember why you are in love, you remember why you just like each other, what’s interesting about each other.”</p><p>In her memoir, <a data-pmc-sp-product=0d86dbfd54ce40d169558bf16637c3b5 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"More Myself","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"More Myself","price":"11.71","id":"125015331X","category":"Blues"},"id":1717755,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>More Myself</a> , Alicia explained how she and Swizz met and started dating each other after both growing up in the Bronx, New York. “We ended up in the same circles at various awards shows and industry events,” she wrote. “He’d usually pull up in some fancy car, rolling deep with his Bronx crew and shining with diamonds. I wanted nothing to do with that scene or with Swizz.”</p><p>She continued, “The more we talked the more I noticed how his mind worked. Beyond the baggy jeans and arm tats there was depth. He was so aware of what was happening around the world.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/More-Myself-Alicia-Keys.jpg><p>For more about Alica Keys, check out her 2020 memoir, <a data-pmc-sp-product=a5328b2f70aad746611063efd19c0bf6 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"More Myself: A Journey","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"More Myself: A Journey","price":"15.99","id":"1250153298","category":"Blues"},"id":1717755,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>More Myself: A Journey</a> .
