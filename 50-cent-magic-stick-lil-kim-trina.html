I had no room for ‘Magic Stick,’ which was written for Get Rich or Die Tryin’ but it didn’t make it,” he explained. “I wrote that record to intentionally work with Trina. I sent it to Trina and they fucked up the record.</p><p>“I was like, ‘Yo.’ The lyrics and everything was messed up. Gee Roberson heard the record and came and got it from me. He was like, ‘Yo, I need this for Kim. I need it.'”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>50 continued: “She had made a good record but it didn’t have the formula that Biggie created for her to have success in our culture. It didn’t have the sexuality. It was like, ‘I’ve been gone for a minute now I’m back….‘ The record with her and Mr. Cheeks… But ‘Magic Stick’ was spot on for her.”</p><p>Check out the interview below:</p><p>The Fantom of the Beat-produced “Magic Stick” arrived in April 2003 after being left on the Get Rich cutting room floor, serving as Kim’s second single from La Bella Mafia.</p><p>The raunchy anthem debuted at No. 75 on the Hot 100 and climbed all the way up to No. 2 but was blocked out by JAY-Z and Bey’s “Crazy In Love.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, 50 admitted that <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>“Many Men” was actually his least favorite GRODT song at the time his 2003 debut arrived</a>.</p><p>“‘<a class=underline-link href=#>Many Men’</a> was my least favorite at that point because musically we was in the boom-bap phase,” he said. “We was in that hard-hitting intensity, the energy on the records, and it’s the slowest song on Get Rich or Die Tryin’. And it’s now the tempo that the artists are rapping to. So the fast tempo, hard-hitting beats, that was that era, that time period. And the whole album had it.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/03/Lil-Kims-La-Bella-Mafia-10-Things-You-May-Or-May-Not-Have-Known-250x142.jpeg alt="10 Things You May (Or May Not) Have Known About Lil Kim's 'La Bella Mafia'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> editorial</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>10 Things You May (Or May Not) Have Known About Lil Kim's 'La Bella Mafia'</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>March 4, 2023</p></a><p>However, the song’s producer, <a class=underline-link href=#>Six Figga Digga, has since refuted 50’s statement in an interview with TMZ</a>.</p><p>“In my humble opinion, that was the point,” he said. “If you got a track like that, along with the other tracks that <a href=# rel=noopener>Dr. Dre</a> did, then it’s not going to sound the same because I’m not Dr. Dre.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“Also, when it was done, it was a different frame of mind, a different way of thinking, so when you’re trying to blend those two things together, I can see that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mhsaWWTmru1ecyanqKbXajBqq%2FKZqOipF2gtq5506ugp5k%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
