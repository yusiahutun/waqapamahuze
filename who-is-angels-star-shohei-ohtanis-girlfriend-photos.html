Namely: who is his girlfriend?</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>my dad keeps googling ‚Äúshohei ohtani girlfriend‚Äù i‚Äôm sick</p><p>‚Äî lyssa‚Å∑6.10 (@blondiehobie) <a href=# rel=noopener>August 29, 2021</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Can anyone tell me?

Speculation started because of a post that apparently went up on her Instagram account:</p><p></p><p>Since then, aside from one minor Twitter interaction, the pair ceased any sort of public engagement. And seeing as Dung‚Äôs Instagram is pretty viral by nature, it feels like that‚Äôs telling:</p><p>It feels like if there was something there, Dung‚Äôs Instagram would show it.</p><p>Which brings us back to the original question of: who is Ohtani‚Äôs girlfriend presently then? At the moment, it feels like he doesn‚Äôt have one. Or at least he doesn‚Äôt have one that he wants to go public with at this time.</p><p>Which makes sense ‚Äì given the sort of treatment other sports celebrity significant others get. Look at what has happened to <a href=#>Patrick Mahomes‚Äô wife</a>, or <a href=#>Russell Wilson‚Äôs wife</a>, or <a href=#>seemingly every NBA wife</a>.</p><p>It‚Äôs brutal stuff.</p><p>Plus, Ohtani‚Äôs lack of romantic commitments would also explain why he is so effective as a player right now. No distractions. No drama. No noise.</p><p>Even the non-romantic relationships he is in right now sometimes <a href=#>seem to cause him a lot of tension</a>.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Yikes.<a href=#>https://t.co/H8xrlAKUem</a></p><p>‚Äî Game 7 (@game7__) <a href=# rel=noopener>May 14, 2022</a></p><p>Maybe once he wins himself a World Series, Ohtani will be more comfortable focusing on other aspects of his life.</p><p>But for now?</p><p>It appears like baseball is enough for him at the moment.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>Kyrie Irving Reacts To Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs Jab On Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers</a></p><p>A longtime sports reporter, Carlos Garcia has written about some of the biggest and most notable athletic events of the last 5 years.
