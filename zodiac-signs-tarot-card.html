There are also 12 zodiac signs, each one representing a different archetype or personality. Because so many spiritual disciplines tend to overlap, it comes as no surprise that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>each zodiac sign rules over a Tarot card</a>. Once you understand why each card is ruled by their corresponding zodiac sign, you’ll be able to unlock deeper insights about yourself and the future that awaits you.</p><p>There have always been stereotypes <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>associated with each zodiac sign</a>. Geminis are known for being flighty and unemotional. Capricorns are famous for being bossy and practical. Taurus has a reputation for spending lots of money on luxury items. But the truth is, these stereotypes barely scratch the surface of what these zodiac signs are capable of. And oftentimes, these stereotypes limit the full scope of their power and inhibit your understanding of them. If you delve into <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>the deeper meanings of each card</a>, you’ll gain an even more profound comprehension of each zodiac sign and what they signify. In fact, the Tarot card associated with each zodiac sign may surprise you, as it reveals a completely different side of their personalities than what is commonly known.</p><p>You can also use this knowledge to ask your Tarot cards <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>even more interesting questions</a>. For example, if you were to ask your Tarot cards when something is going to happen and you draw the Death card, it could be a sign that it will happen during Scorpio season. If you were to ask your Tarot cards who your future husband will be and you draw the Emperor card, it could mean that your future husband will be an Aries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-tarot-card-associated-with-each-zodiac-sign>The Tarot Card Associated With Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>If you want to discover cooler ways to use your Tarot cards or an even deeper understanding <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">of your birth chart</a>, here’s the Tarot card that has always been associated with each zodiac sign:</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9><h2>Aries: The Emperor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/10.png><p>Aries is the first sign in the zodiac, which is why it is often known for being “number one”. Aries is bold, aggressive, and not afraid of conflict, which is one reason why they’re associated with The Emperor. However, this card captures the way Aries is more than just an impulsive hot-head, but a fierce leader who stands up for themselves and leads the way. The Emperor is associated with confidence, ambition, drive, and the need to take initiative. Aries is always the first to try something, the first to speak up, and the first to finish the race. They weren’t just born to be Emperor, because they worked hard for it too. Aries is more than just a fighter, but a strategist who usurps your throne.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Courage, leadership, authority, ego, and ambition</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.5><h2>Taurus: The Hierophant</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Copy-of-Untitled-960-×-540-px-2.png><p>Taurus is associated with luxury, romance, and pleasure, which is why it may come as a shock that it is associated with the Hierophant. This card is often associated with religion, spiritual traditions, and belief systems, but underneath all things holy and theological, the Hierophant is about what you value and appreciate. Taurus also symbolizes your value system, as it’s only associated with money and material pleasures because we ascribe value to those things. However, it is your values that dictate your beliefs, your actions, and the rules you follow. And like Taurus, the Hierophant represents the earthly manifestations of your spiritual beliefs and the way they impact your everyday life.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Belief systems, spiritual wisdom, education, values, and tradition</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6><h2>Gemini: The Lovers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Copy-of-Untitled-960-×-540-px-3.png><p>You may be surprised that flighty and overly intellectual Gemini is associated with the Lovers card. However, this card proves that Gemini is a far more romantic zodiac sign than anyone ever told you. The Lovers represents the duality of life that exists in our relationships, our beliefs, and our decisions. It is the union of opposites coming together to form a whole idea. It represents two very different possibilities, forcing you to choose the best possible outcome. Love cannot exist without two people communicating and exchanging energy, just like Gemini needs to be able to bounce their ideas off someone else. In astrology, Gemini is symbolically tied to the “twins”, showcasing their adaptable and dual-sided nature that can see both sides of an argument. The Tarot simply takes this metaphor and turns it into something more passionate.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Communication, choices, partnership, intellectual exchange, and harmony</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8><h2>Cancer: The Chariot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Copy-of-Untitled-960-×-540-px-8.png><p>In astrology, Cancer is known for being a soft, sweet, and sentimental homebody. However, the Tarot sheds light Cancer’s true power and dominance, as it is tied to The Chariot. This card symbolizes action, willpower, and drive, urging you to take action and slam on the gas pedal. Although Cancer is often stereotyped as a shy and sensitive wallflower, this card proves that Cancer is also a warrior. The Chariot harnesses the empathy and emotional intelligence of Cancer in order to make courageous decisions. It reminds you that in order to build the home you’ve always wanted, you first have to be willing to journey out of your comfort zone and take control of your success. The Chariot reminds us that Cancer is a cardinal sign, making them a go-getter at heart.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Willpower, domination, action, drive, and campaigning</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9><h2>Leo: The Sun</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/3_08c0f7.png><p>The least surprising correlation of all is Leo being ruled by The Sun card. After all, Leo is also ruled by the Sun in astrology, as this celestial body is associated with confidence, self-expression, character-building, and artistic nourishment. Leo always wants to be seen in all its glory, which is why it loves to bask in the illuminating light of the Sun. Without the Sun, there would be no growth, no abundance, and no color. Everything revolves around the Sun, just like everyone can’t help but notice the Leo in the room. When you draw the Sun card in a Tarot reading, it is a sign that you should step away from the shadows and into the spotlight. It’s a sign that you should embrace your creative instincts, nourish what matters to you, and acknowledge how awesome you are.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Creativity, optimism, self-expression, joy, and confidence</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7><h2>Virgo: The Hermit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Copy-of-Untitled-960-×-540-px-4.png><p>Virgo is often lauded as one of the most intelligent signs in the zodiac. Virgo observes their surroundings, absorbs information, and must retreat from the world in order to process all that they know. That’s one reason why Virgo is associated with The Hermit card. However, this card sheds light on the more spiritual and introspective aspect of Virgo’s power, which is often ignored. The Hermit leaves the world behind and embraces solitude, where they can tap into their inner wisdom, reconnect with their higher self, and excavate deep truths from the core of their soul. Virgo is more than just a factoid or an intellect, but a soul-searcher that strives to attain hidden knowledge. This card also shines a light on the loneliness of the Virgo experience, as few can meet them on their intellectual level.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Introspection, soul-searching, solitude, higher awareness, and spiritual knowledge</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7><h2>Libra: Justice</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2_adba4b.png><p>Libra is often reduced to nothing more than being indecisive, conflict-avoidant, and flirtatious. However, the Tarot reflects a much darker and more powerful side of Libra, as it is associated with the Justice card. Libra’s concern with balance, fairness, and harmony is also what makes them the lawyer of the zodiac. This cardinal air sign is always weighing the pros and cons and attempting to balance the scales. And when rules are broken and ethics are disregarded, Libra is always there to make sure Justice is being served. Libra will always fight for what’s right, making it the zodiac sign of karma and consequences. Let’s not forget that Saturn—planet of discipline and restriction—is also considered “exalted” when it is in Libra. Although Libra is sweet, they have no problem being sour when Justice is needed.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Law, karma, integrity, cause and effect, and accountability</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.5><h2>Scorpio: Death</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Copy-of-Untitled-960-×-540-px-5.png><p>When you think of Scorpio, you probably think of someone who’s good at having sex and holding grudges. However, that’s just a superficial understanding of Scorpio, as this is the zodiac sign of transformation, alchemy, and metamorphosis. If you pull the Death card during a Tarot reading, it does not necessarily mean something—or someone—is going to die. But it does mean that something is coming to an end so that something new can begin. Even in astrology, Scorpio is associated with the action of giving up one thing in favor of another. This zodiac sign is the epitome of that age-old saying: “When one door closes, another one opens.” The same goes for the definition of the Death card, as nothing ever truly comes to an end, because Death is only the beginning.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Transformation, resurrection, release, new beginnings, and transitions</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.5><h2>Sagittarius: Temperance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Copy-of-Untitled-960-×-540-px-6.png><p>When you think of Sagittarius, you probably think of an explorer or a thrill-seeker; someone who’s willing to embrace extremes for the sake of an adrenaline-pumping adventure. That’s why it may seem confusing that Sagittarius is associated with Temperance, as this is the card of balance, moderation, and patience. But it reveals the more spiritual and philosophical aspect of Sagittarius, as this mutable fire sign craves experiences that expand their consciousness and opens their mind. In order for Sagittarius to obtain higher truths, they need to consider all sides of an argument and the nuances involved. The reason Sagittarius loves spontaneity so much is because it provides a much-needed contrast to the monotony of day-to-day life. However, if Sagittarius does nothing but go on adventures, the excitement loses its meaning. When Sagittarius goes up, they eventually must come down. When Sagittarius goes on a journey, it means nothing unless they come home. Temperance speaks to the way Sagittarius embraces patience for the sake of enlightenment.</p><p><strong>Keywords: </strong>Balance, moderation, patience, serenity, and enlightenment</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.5><h2>Capricorn: The Devil</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/8.png><p>Capricorn is concerned with attaining their ambitions, keeping up with public appearances, and sustaining a position of authority. However, behind that carefully constructed facade are plenty of dark secrets. The richest and most successful person on Earth also has vices, bad habits, and addictions they pretend don’t exist. They have heavy burdens and profound sadness that their followers know nothing about. The Devil card represents the shadow side of your personality; the truths that you hide from others in order to maintain a polished reputation. And while this definitely does not mean Capricorns are the Devil, it does mean that Capricorns are usually much more complicated than they’d ever want the world to know. And when a Capricorn judges themselves too harshly, they limit their ultimate potential. When they hide their truth for far too long, it eventually comes back to haunt them.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Vices, attachments, excess, subconscious energies, shadow self</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6><h2>Aquarius: The Star</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Copy-of-Untitled-960-×-540-px-7.png><p>“When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are.” Aquarius is the visionary of the zodiac; the one who sees potential for a brighter future. They’re the ones who look to the great beyond, having hopes that glimmer like faraway stars. The Star card symbolizes your wildest dreams and most meaningful wishes, especially when it comes to making the world a better place. Aquarius is the quintessential humanitarian of the zodiac, and The Star captures the way they shine brightest when they’re helping others and believing in a better tomorrow. Even when nothing makes sense and nothing is going right, Aquarius is always looking up at the skies, knowing they can reach for the stars. Aquarius understands that hope is never truly lost, just like The Star encourages you to never give up on what you believe in.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Hopes, dreams, wishes, humanitarianism, and faith</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8><h2>Pisces: The Moon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4_76123f.png><p>In astrology, Pisces represents the depth of your unconscious mind. It symbolizes all that exists just beneath the surface of your reality, encouraging you to explore beyond what you know and discover what lies deep within. The Moon card represents the part of yourself that is primal, wild, and intuitive. The Moon reigns at night, when society is fast asleep and we become receptive to receiving psychic downloads. And when the Moon is shining bright and the world has powered down, it is finally quiet enough for you to reconnect with your inner knowing, rediscover your ancient instincts, and embrace your intuition. However, there is danger that lurks at night, which is why exploring your psyche exposes your sensitivities and reveals your innermost fears. After all, Pisces has to be sensitive and vulnerable in order to be susceptible to spiritual energies.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Unconscious, intuition, primal instincts, sensitivity, and dream states</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfr7yltcCcZKyhl6PAbsDAq6atZZOWv6V7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
