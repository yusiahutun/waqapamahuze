I love chai tea, and I thought this was a great interpretation. I only ran into one snag: I didn’t have any coconut oil. I thought I had some in the back of the cupboard, but alas, I did not. I was torn between using melted butter and vegetable oil, and after about 10 minutes of staring at the cupboard, I decided on oil.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/zodiacsignsasdesserts.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1"> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kitchenaid-black-friday-sale.jpg><p>The bread was delicious. It was moist and very flavorful. My only criticism is that I would add less cardamom. It’s a very powerful spice and I found it standing out among the other spices instead of blending in. I would say the same in general for recipes that only use nutmeg. A little dab will do ya! I could tell that the coconut would add a very nice flavor. I love having excuses for trying recipes again.</p><p>When I first started this blog, I mostly used tried-and-true, sourced recipes from well-known and established sites like <a href=# rel=nofollow>Epicurious</a> or <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bon Appetit</a>, occasionally throwing in a few of my own creations that I adapted from old family recipes. I’m well aware of my own limitations of being creative with baking and as a result, I love discovering new recipes.</p><p>I’m so glad that over the past few months, I’ve almost exclusively baked with recipes I’ve found within my own blog community. It’s a great way to get to know fellow bakers and finding people who are as passionate about baking as I am.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/chai-spice-banana-bread2.jpg><p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p><p>For the banana bread:</p><p>1 ½ cups flour<br>¼ cup white whole wheat flour<br>1 teaspoon baking powder<br>1 teaspoon baking soda<br>½ teaspoon salt<br>1 teaspoon cinnamon<br>1 teaspoon ginger<br>¾ teaspoon cardamom<br>¼ teaspoon cloves<br>¼ teaspoon nutmeg<br>1 ½ cups mashed ripe banana<br>½ cup honey<br>¼ cup canola oil<br>½ cup low-fat buttermilk, at room temperature<br>1 large egg, at room temperature<br>1 ½ teaspoon vanilla</p><p>For the glaze:</p><p>1 ½ tablespoon unsalted butter<br>2/3 cup powdered sugar, sifted<br>½ teaspoon vanilla extract<br>1 tablespoon milk</p><p><strong>Instructions</strong></p><p>Make the banana bread</p><li>Preheat oven to 350°F and spray a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray. Whisk together flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, cloves, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the mixture. Combine banana, honey, oil, buttermilk, egg, and vanilla-bean paste in a medium bowl; add to flour mixture and fold in just until combined. Spoon batter into prepared pan and smooth top with an offset spatula.</li><li>Bake for 30 minutes; rotate pan and cover with foil to prevent over browning. Continue baking another 30 minutes. Bread is done when golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs attached. Cool in pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes; carefully remove bread from pan and cool completely.</li><p>Make the glaze</p><li class=blog-yumprint-method-item>Cook butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly until it foams, turns clear, and then turns a deep brown, about 6 minutes. Whisk together brown butter, powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk in a small bowl. Drizzle glaze over cooled bread and let set before slicing and serving.</li><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Cheryl Vivian</a> is a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>neurotic baker</a>&nbsp;who came to D.C. via Detroit, Chicago, and New York City.
