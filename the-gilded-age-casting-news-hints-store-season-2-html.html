But it sounds like he might have found a new potential wife in season 2. Nicole Brydon Bloom will play socialite Caroline Stuyvesant. Oscar sees the heiress as the perfect wife, while she finds him to be a valued confidant.

The two had plans to elope, but then Marian discovered that Tom had no intention of going through with the marriage and instead hoped to marry a wealthy heiress.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_35>Marian’s romantic disappointment seemed to set the stage for a possible relationship between her and Larry Russell. The two developed a friendship in season 1, but Fellowes isn’t saying whether it turns into something more.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_73>“We’re never going to tell you what we’re going to do next year, but yes, I do feel sorry for Marian,” he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>. “Agnes knew he had a different agenda and that in the end, he would be seduced by New York. That was exactly what Marian refused to see. So I hope there’s a lesson in there for someone that it isn’t always the sympathetic people who give the right advice.”</p><p id=par-14_7>Check out <a href=#>Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a> on Facebook!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMoKClnJWZeqKzxGaamquknruoec2erqxlmJ67tb%2BMrKuoqpViwKat0qilZmpencGuuI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
