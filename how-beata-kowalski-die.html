Beata Kowalski died by suicide 87 days after Maya was taken by the state. “I’m sorry,” her suicide note read according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.thecut.com/article/child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy.html>The Cut,</a> “but I no longer can take the pain being away from Maya and being treated like a criminal. I cannot watch my daughter suffer in pain and keep getting worse while my hands are tied by the state of FL and the judge!” Maya was then returned to her family after her mother’s death.</p><p>According to her husband Jack Kowalski, Beata was distressed by having <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1344988/william-harry-meghan-documentary/ rel="noreferrer noopener">her daughter</a> taken away from her. “We, as parents, try to do the best we can for our children,” Jack says in the documentary. “You do everything for them. That’s what Beata and I did. But there’s nothing that could have prepared me for what I went through with my family. Nothing.”</p><p>On her mother’s legacy and what she remembers of her, Maya told<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://people.com/take-care-of-maya-munchausen-by-proxy-accusation-maya-kowalski-mom-death-by-suicide-7509016 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> People,</a> “I remember small things but not full stories. She was always the type of person to try and make me feel better….she went the extra mile to make people smile.”&nbsp;She later said, “One day I was in the ICU, and my mom kissed me on the forehead and was like, ‘I love you. I’ll see you tomorrow.’ I never saw her again. I was medically kidnapped. I tried being hopeful, but there was a point where I thought, ‘I’m never getting out of this place.” She continued, “For us as a family to move on, we need to fulfill my mom’s wish and fight. I want justice for my mom.”</p><p>“Psychologically, it destroyed all of us,” Maya’s father told The Cut. “When somebody knocks on our door, now you don’t want to answer it because you’re worried it’s somebody from Children and Families. You don’t want your child to play sports because if they get hurt, where am I going to take them?”</p><p>On June 24, 2023,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>DailyMail</a>&nbsp;reported that Maya Kowalski’s family is pursuing a lawsuit against Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital seeking $55 million in compensatory and $165 million in punitive damages. The court date is set for September 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Take_Care_Of_Maya_image0.jpeg><p>“I watched the Kowalskis disintegrate and then try to move on without the linchpin — the wife and mother,” Greg Anderson, the Kowalski’s attorney told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a>. “Beata was a force of nature in taking care of her family. The depth of loss is beyond words.” Anderson has been their attorney for the past seven years and considers himself an extension of the family. Living with the heavy weight of pending litigation and hope for the upcoming trial has affected Anderson and his own family. “[My three kids] have literally not known what life is like without the Kowalski case,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>Sally Smith talked to The Cut about her decision to keep Maya&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>from her family.</a>&nbsp;She, along with her former employer Suncoast settled a lawsuit with the Kowalskis for $2.5 million.&nbsp;“I am not a horrible person whose goal in life is to disrupt families,” Sally Smith said. “I have spent my adult life attempting to serve children in my community to ameliorate conditions of abuse and neglect. I wish our society did more to help struggling families to provide safe, nurturing homes to their children. I’m not a big proponent of punitive approaches for such families contrary to media portrayals about me.” And she said, about her subspecialty, “I wish that people who seek to vilify child abuse pediatricians would somehow find the critical knowledge, tools and framework to better understand and represent the tremendous challenges these children and their families and caretakers present for our society and for physicians.“</p><p>Take Care Of Maya is available to stream on Netflix.</p><p>If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health crisis, help is available.
