The treatment solution is sprayed on to small sections of the hair, dispersed with a brush, and left to set for 15 minutes. A thorough blow dry with a round or paddle brush is next, followed by the hair being flat ironed at 360 degrees. Each section of hair gets three to six passes of the flat iron depending on how coarse it is. Afterwards, the hair is shampooed to wash off residual treatment spray and styled as desired.<br><strong>Results:&nbsp;</strong>Not pin straight, but visibly smoother and shinier, and more resistant to humidity.

Next, it’s covered with a plastic bag for 30 minutes to allow the treatment to penetrate. Afterwards the hair is dried—either with a blow dryer or under a hair dryer—and again divided into small sections. Each section is flat ironed five to eight times with the iron set at 360 degrees. A post-treatment shampoo is optional but not necessary.<br><strong>Results:&nbsp;</strong>In addition so sleek, frizz-free hair, the treatment cuts hair-drying time down by as much as 50 percent.&nbsp;Results last between two and&nbsp;three months.<br><strong>Worth noting:&nbsp;</strong>This is a popular partial-hair treatment, with many often opting to get it just for the bangs or the hair that frames the face.<br><strong>Price:</strong>&nbsp;$450 at New York City’s<strong>&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>Sam Brocato Salon</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong><br>—Explained by<b>&nbsp;</b><strong>Sam Brocato</strong>, treatment developer and owner of Sam Brocato Salon</p><p><strong>Treatment:</strong>&nbsp;<b><i>Magic Sleek</i></b><br><strong>Key Ingredients:&nbsp;</strong>Peptides<br><strong>How it’s done: </strong>Hair is shampooed, conditioned, towel dried, and then spritzed all over with the treatment. The solution sets for up to 45 minutes depending on how coarse the hair texture is. The treatment is then rinsed off with water; lightly for those who want a super-straight result, and more thoroughly for those seeking a modest relaxation of their natural texture. Next, the hair is rough dried and then blown out with a brush. Sections are flat ironed up to 15 times at 400 degrees and then sprayed with a setting solution.
