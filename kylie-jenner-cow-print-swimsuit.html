However, the unique suit—one of the first to forgo animal prints like leopard, cheetah and zebra in favor of the unexpected brown and white cow print—sold out fairly quickly, because, well, that’s what happens when Jenner wears anything semi-affordable. I thought I’d get over it eventually, but then her <a href=# rel=nofollow>older sis Khloé Kardashian</a> posted in the same. damn. swimsuit. a few months later, and I had to come to terms with the fact that I simply could not live without this one-piece.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anua-heartleaf-toner-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/beauty-of-joseon-fi.jpg><p>For myself and others that lusted after the look, <a href=# rel=nofollow>WeWoreWhat</a> has some great news. The suit is back in stock, baby! Its official name is the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Danielle One Piece</a>, and though the brand also dropped <a href=# rel=nofollow>a bikini version</a> this morning with the relaunch, that style is already sold out. Can you believe?! Don’t worry, you can <a href=# rel=nofollow>pre-order it now</a> to ensure you get it the moment it comes back in stock. Still, the one-piece is fair game. It’ll run you just under $200, but it’s safe to say this is a suit you can keep in your collection for quite some time, as it’s <a href=#>just as on-trend</a> in June 2020 as it was when Jenner first rocked it in January 2019.</p><p>Oh, and get this—yet another reason to buy. For every cowhide swimsuit sold, WeWoreWhat will donate a portion of proceeds to the <a href=# rel=nofollow>NAACP</a>. The brand also pledged to allocate 15% of their marketing budget to Black models and creators, so they’re stepping up to ensure their branding looks as diverse as their clientele. Baby steps, but we love to see it!</p><p>Below, <a href=# id=auto-tag_shop data-tag=shop>shop</a> Jenner’s iconic suit and a few similar-enough dupes for when the WeWoreWhat style (inevitably) sells out again. I’ve already placed my order.</p><h2>1.
