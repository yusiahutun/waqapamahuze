He has zero worry with her, they seem to get each other and get along quite well.”</p><p>A source also told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a> at the time that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brady and Shayk</a> had been dating “for a few weeks” before news broke of their relationship. “[They] have been in touch for a few weeks,” the insider said. “There is a spark.” The source claimed that Brady invited Shayk to “fly out and meet up in Los Angeles,” where “they spent the night Friday and Saturday at a house” where Brady was staying.&nbsp;</p><p>The source continued, “There is an attraction.” The insider also confirmed that Brady and Shayk “have never been involved romantically before” their current relationship, despite Shayk’s professional friendship with Brady’s ex-wife. The insider also claimed that Brady and Shayk first started dating when they were both guests at billionaire art heir Joe Nahmad’s wedding to model Madison Headrick in Sardinia, Italy back in June 2023.</p><p>But what does Cooper think?

A source told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Daily Mail</a> on July 25, 2023, that Cooper was “bothered” by rumors Shayk and Brady were dating and worried that the former NFL star would “take her heart away from him forever.”&nbsp;</p><p>“To say he is not bothered by this would be a lie,” the insider said. “He has been on and off and on with Irina and he has so much love for her.” The source continued, “She is the mother to his girl and they are his two favorite women in the world. He feels that, for the first time, she met someone in Tom that would take her heart away from him forever.”</p><p>Despite his issues around Shayk and Brady’s relationship, the source also told The Daily Mail that Cooper was “conflicted” by the romance because he had “dated other women” too since their breakup in 2019. The insider continued, “Tom is very capable of being a devoted husband and parent and husband. This is what gets to Bradley.”</p><p>A source, however, told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> on July 25 that Cooper wasn’t bothered by Shayk and Brady’s relationship because he didn’t think it would last. “Right now, he is taking a wait-and-see attitude,” the insider said. “[Brady and Shayk] didn’t declare their love. This could be over in two, three weeks.” The source continued, “He isn’t freaked out.”</p><p>As for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Brady’s ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen</a>, a source told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Daily Mail</a> on July 24, 2023, that the model went through a “revolving door of emotions” when she first heard rumors of Brady and Shayk dating, but the is “currently in a good place with it all and is hoping for the best.” The insider added that Brady and Shayk’s relationship was “difficult” for Bündchen at first and “she was upset,” however, she’s gotten over those feelings. “It made things more real. She and Tom had something so amazing, it ended,” the insider said.&nbsp;</p><p>The source continued, “The emotions from that, especially after sharing children, were as emotional as it gets but then she knew she couldn’t hold on to something that was never going to return, she knew this day would come and she honestly would love nothing more than for Tom to be happy.”</p><p>The Daily Mail’s insider explained that Bündchen’s main issue with Brady dating after their divorce was that she didn’t want him to end up with someone who wasn’t “right for their kids.”</p><p>“She will have a love for him like no other, but her main concern and a part of the healing process is that he chooses someone that is not only right for him but right for their kids,” the source said. “Floozy is not the word, but Gisele doesn’t want some random person leading Tom down a bad path.”</p><p>The insider also confirmed that Brady told Bündchen about the relationship himself before news became public. “Tom is not stupid either, he made sure that Gisele was in the know, and they still have that communication as co-parents,” the source said.”’But overall, Gisele is just processing it all and coming to a point where she wants to be OK with it and will be OK with it. So she definitely took an elevator of emotions, but she’s currently in a good place with it all and is hoping for the best.”&nbsp;</p><p>A source also told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> on July 25, 2023, that Bündchen was “totally unbothered” by Brady and Shayk’s relationship. “[She’s] happy he’s moved on because she has too,” the insider said. “She knew he would be dating at some point and really isn’t concerned one way or another.” The source added that Brady and Bündchen’s relationship “is based on coparenting their children.” The insider added, “Other than that, Tom is obviously free to date whoever he likes.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> also reported on July 24, 2023, that Bündchen was “not happy at all” about Brady and Shayk’s relationship. However, another report claimed that she was “happy” her ex-husband had moved on. “Why wouldn’t she be happy for Tom? She divorced him. It is helpful to her freedom that he moved on,” another source told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TMZ</a>. The source also confirmed that Shayk and Bündchen were not friends, though they’ve known each other professionally for years as both models.&nbsp;</p><p>A source also confirmed to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a> on July 25, 2023, that Bündchen was on vacation in her home country of Brazil when news of Brady and Shayk’s relationship broke. “[She] is on holiday in Brazil at the moment and is living her life, but she’s said in the past that she just wants him to be happy,” the insider said.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-TB-Method-Tom-Brady.jpg><p>For more about <a href=# id=auto-tag_tom-brady data-tag=tom-brady>Tom Brady</a>, read his book, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The TB12 Method</a>.
