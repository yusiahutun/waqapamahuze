We've found very few skincare unicorns out there that actually tackle a boatload of skin concerns all at once, and exfoliating peel pads are one of them. They look like normal makeup wipes (and they're just as easy to use), but each peel pad is pre-soaked with powerful exfoliating and brightening ingredients that you wipe all over your face and then you just let the magic of clearer, brighter, and more even-looking skin come to you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In fact, using an exfoliating peel pad is so mind-bogglingly effortless that you may even think you're doing it wrong (you're probably not), but as the pads rev up your skin's cellular turnover behind the scenes and you watch your dark spots fade, clogged pores clear, fine lines appear softer, and your skin boasting a newfound radiance, you'll know you did it very right.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're wondering if it gets better than this, it does: We found a wide variety of strong formulas that are balanced with soothing herbs to sidestep irritation and humectants to attract moisture to the skin, making them gentle enough for sensitive, reactive complexions and even rosacea-prone skin.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-dr-dennis-gross-alpha-beta-universal-daily-peel></span> <a href=# rel="noskim noopener nofollow sponsored" data-retailer-type=AMAZON data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" data-amazon-asin=B074JCCQC6 id=product-record__image_1-0 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Universal Daily Peel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/W_-y1rUyQIxT8QHjWKqoeOFAttI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dr-dennis-gross-skincare-alpha-beta-universal-daily-peel-586ec65f4eb948ff9766f7a95c173f1c.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This product is the OG chemical peel and remains our favorite due to its ease, efficacy, and non-sensitizing formulation.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> Truly lazy skincare aficionados may not enjoy the fact that there are two steps.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve been using these peels for over a decade and won’t stop anytime soon! They’re also a favorite of Dr. Kiran Mian, a board-certified dermatologist at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Hudson Dermatology & Laser Surgery</a>. “I love Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta peel pads for those with acne as they really help combat the keratin buildup in the skin,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike most peels on the market, this derm-developed formula features two steps — one exfoliator and one neutralizer — to deliver concentrated doses of ingredients for maximum results. When using the first step, lactic, salicylic, malic, and more acids work to resurface skin, while the second step infuses the skin with retinol, green tea, and antioxidants to pamper, nourish, and deliver further anti-aging results.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The second step is a good thing: It means you won’t have to rinse your face after using, so you can swipe this peel on with ease, whether you’re on the go or lazing around on the couch watching TV. You’ll instantly see more luminous and smoother skin, but over time, you’ll watch as your fine lines, wrinkles, enlarged pores, and discoloration fade away.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those who are easily annoyed by multiple skincare steps, you could be irked by the fact that this peel features a second step, but don’t be put off — this product couldn’t be easier to use. Just swipe, wait two minutes, and swipe again. While we’d recommend following the second step with moisturizer, we’ll note that if you’re truly feeling lazy, this product doesn’t leave our skin feeling super stripped, so go ahead and hit the hay without it if you must!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid｜<strong>Best for:</strong> Dullness, acne, fine lines and wrinkles｜<strong>Size: </strong>35 treatments</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-elf-superglow-aha-peel-pads></span> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored noskim" data-retailer-type=SKIMLINKS data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" id=product-record__image_1-0-1 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ELF SuperGlow AHA Peel Pads" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8Ia-qroBcXdbp-AT0L9zrDMa720=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ELF-SuperGlow-AHA-Peel-Pads-3c13a5750d09478b84552349128d3285.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ELF</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These peels are very gentle, but still work well to resurface skin.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The pads are on the small side and very thin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s rare to find such a great peel at this price point, especially one that won’t irritate sensitive skin. It uses a gentle blend of AHAs and fruit enzymes to break down and remove dead cells; the peel pad isn’t textured so it won’t feel abrasive on the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While those with coarser skin may prefer texture, it’s this smooth finish that makes the product especially ideal for easily sensitized skin. However, the pads are fairly thin, meaning that they don't hold as much solution as other peel pads on our list. If you’re expecting to use one pad across a lot of real estate, you'll probably only get face and neck coverage before needing to grab a second wipe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Alpha-hydroxy acids, papaya enzymes｜<strong>Best for: </strong>Dullness｜<strong>Size:</strong> 45 treatments</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-loral-paris-revitalift-bright-reveal-anti-aging-exfoliating-peel-pads></span> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored noskim" data-retailer-type=SKIMLINKS data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" id=product-record__image_1-0-2 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon L'Or&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;al Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Anti-Aging Exfoliating Peel Pads" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/t-xnHXsXrJaYfUtdSCqFuv2zHbo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/LOreal-Paris-Revitalift-Bright-Reveal-Anti-Aging-Exfoliating-Peel-Pads-1438d41ee77042c29cc79e0f99386de2.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These peels smell surprisingly delicious.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> These may be best for more mature skin, which can frequently better tolerate glycolic acid.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most peels smell like a noxious blend of chemicals, which we typically choose to ignore considering all the benefits they provide our skin once we power through every use. These peels from L’Oréal are a pleasant surprise — they deliver real results while offering a subtle citrusy aroma. Those results come courtesy of glycolic acid, one of the most popular alpha-hydroxy acids due to its ability to powerfully resurface skin. The formula also features glycerin, a humectant that helps prevent skin from dehydrating, a common side effect of chemical peels.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These peels are potent, with some users reporting irritation and breakouts after a few treatments. That can be par for the course with some peels, as the cellular turnover can cause blemishes to rise to the surface and leave skin feeling sensitive. More resilient skin, including mature skin, may do best with this drugstore treatment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Glycolic acid, glycerin｜<strong>Best for: </strong>Dullness, fine lines｜<strong>Size:</strong> 30 treatments</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-hyperpigmentation-strivectin-daily-reveal-exfoliating-face-pads-with-aha--bha--pha--txa></span> <a href=# rel="noskim noopener nofollow sponsored" data-retailer-type=AMAZON data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" data-amazon-asin=B089TPYFX3 id=product-record__image_1-0-3 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="StriVectin Daily Reveal Exfoliating Face Pads with AHA + BHA + PHA + TXA" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/oEqZZQ0LHQc1Qx7e2D-FeFFXsSM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/StriVectinDailyRevealExfoliatingFacePadswithAHABHAPHATXA-90d46079e51b4c2e8716b616b99479bf.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>StriVectin</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This product features tranexamic acid, a potent dark spot fighter.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The formula may be too strong for some skin types.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These peels from StriVectin feature a veritable alphabet soup of exfoliating acids. Amongst the AHAs, you’ll find glycolic acid, BHA salicylic acid, and tranexamic acid, one of the most powerful ingredients in the hyperpigmentation-fighting arsenal. The chemical peel pads feature a nubby texture that further helps to resurface skin. With consistent use of these peel pads, you’ll see a brighter, clearer complexion with smoother texture, fewer dark spots, and smaller pores.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because of the powerhouse blend of ingredients in this peel solution, these pads are very strong. This isn’t a bad thing, as it tends to equal visible results for super stubborn skin concerns, hyperpigmentation and large clogged pores, that are quick to appear after just a few treatments. These peels are meant to be used daily, but considering their strength, it's a good idea to start slowly integrating it into your routine once or twice a week and ramping up from there as your skin tolerates the actives.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Glycolic acid, gluconolactone, tranexamic acid｜<strong>Best for:</strong> Dullness, discoloration, uneven texture｜<strong>Size: </strong>60 treatments</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-sensitive-skin-lancer-skincare-gentle-exfoliating-peel-pads></span> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored noskim" data-retailer-type=SKIMLINKS data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" id=product-record__image_1-0-4 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dermstore Lancer Skincare Gentle Exfoliating Peel Pads" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/G6TabidJAYaTs28MWOJW43YwdHQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lancer-Skincare-Gentle-Exfoliating-Peel-Pads-52cd9d1f4dc8421497ef77081bf96d79.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermstore</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This formula uses botanical retinol alternative bakuchiol to improve skin tone and texture without irritating skin.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>It can leave a tacky feeling on the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Chemical peels often leave skin feeling irritated, making it hard for people with sensitive skin to find an exfoliation solution that works for them. This derm-developed peel is gentler than most, thanks to lactic acid and bakuchiol, a plant-based ingredient that offers results that are comparable to those of true retinol, but without the irritating side effects. It also helps slough off dead skin with papaya enzymes, which help dissolve the bonds securing those cells to the surface, leaving skin looking refreshed. But our favorite ingredient, oatmeal, simultaneously helps calm skin and seal moisture for a stronger skin barrier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only irksome factor of this product is how it dries — it can cause the skin to feel sticky, even after the formula has dried. However, there’s an easy solution to that: Just use it at night before moisturizing. This way, it won’t interfere with any makeup application.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Bakuchiol, lactic acid, papaya enzyme｜<strong>Best for: </strong>Dullness, discoloration, fine lines｜<strong>Size: </strong>45 treatments</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-mature-skin-dr-loretta-micro-peel-peptide-pads></span> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored noskim" data-retailer-type=SKIMLINKS data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" id=product-record__image_1-0-5 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Dr. Loretta Micro Peel Peptide Pads" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/VyQumB0XdbNoN4n-DPREDJPr_2I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Dr-Loretta-Micro-Peel-Peptide-Pads-a1e0c7d4d30044eb82efe3d2b7f01f52.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This formula features a steep concentration of glycolic acid to combat wrinkles.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> You’re meant to wash off the peel for the first few weeks, which may be inconvenient for some.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While not all chemical peel brands disclose the concentration of ingredients used in their formulas, this dermatologist-created formula does — and it contains a remarkable 10 percent concentration of glycolic acid to effectively slough away dead skin cells to fade fine lines and discoloration while reducing the appearance of enlarged pores. Guarana extract, a powerful antioxidant, protects skin from free radical damage and amino acid-rich algae peptides penetrate into the skin's deeper layers to speed up collagen production and visibly firm skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because these peels are so strong, you’ll have to rinse them off 10 to 20 minutes after using them for the first few weeks (your skin will need time to learn to tolerate the formula’s potency). This may be annoying, but it's temporary; once you get past the initial acclimation period, you won’t have to rinse off the treatment and the results are worth it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Glycolic acid, algae peptides, guarana extract｜<strong>Best for:</strong> Fine lines, discoloration, enlarged pores｜<strong>Size: </strong>60 treatments</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-korean-dermalogy-by-neogenlab-bio-peel-gauze-peeling-pads-with-green-tea></span> <a href=# rel="noskim noopener nofollow sponsored" data-retailer-type=AMAZON data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" data-amazon-asin=B01GZ1QXAI id=product-record__image_1-0-6 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon DERMALOGY by NEOGENLAB Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Pads with Green Tea" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mUZ7IxteLLZ88nZ16i2JCCvx0Gs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/DERMALOGY-by-NEOGENLAB-Bio-Peel-Gauze-Peeling-Pads-with-Green-Tea-dca411ba55824569bc376f71d883bc28.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The peel pad is double sided so you can customize your exfoliation experience.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>If you’re looking for a super-strong peel, this may not be the right one for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While many peels feature strong chemical aromas, this one features a botanical fragrance that won’t irritate sensitive noses — and the product won’t irritate your complexion either. It boasts centella asiatica, green tea, and hyaluronic acid to help soothe, calm, and hydrate, as well as a bevy of exfoliants, including PHA, a notoriously gentle ingredient that resurfaces skin without causing too much sensitivity.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Each pad is designed like a little pouch so you can insert your fingers into it to use both the coarser woven texture (which is meant to take off dead skin) and a lightly textured side to push the solution into the skin while boosting skin’s hydration levels. These peel pads are so big that some people even cut them in half to get double the peels out of each jar.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the blend of potent ingredients, this peel is not super powerful (which is what makes it so ideal for sensitive skin).

Tula's chemical peel is designed to be used in lieu of toner and even better, the formula taps gentler ingredients, like apple cider vinegar rather than alcohol, to loosen debris found in clogged pores.

This acne-targeting peel is no exception. It boasts three effective resurfacers, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and azelaic acid, but it's the azelaic that does the heavy lifting to curb inflammation (making it great for cystic acne) and ease discoloration, while niacinamide targets post-breakout scars.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's tough to beat the convenience and efficacy of these peels, despite the fact that they're not a leave-on formula. Unlike other peels, you'll wait 15 minutes after wiping down your face before rinsing it off. If you’re someone who likes to do their skincare routine in bed (no judgment!), be sure to build extra time into your regimen for this formula.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Salicylic acid, glycolic acid, azelaic acid｜<strong>Best for: </strong>Acne, discoloration, dullness｜<strong>Size:</strong> 30 treatments<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-bikini-area-first-aid-beauty-ingrown-hair-pads></span> <a href=# rel="noskim noopener nofollow sponsored" data-retailer-type=AMAZON data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" data-amazon-asin=B09PMRPRZQ id=product-record__image_1-0-10 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora First Aid Beauty Ingrown Hair Pads" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BoJd3DeyL-hK_doYSrrBlFW5DeA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/first-aid-beauty-ingrown-hair-pads-e55fbef754894ea4a7522a6629c7881d.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This peel pad helps prevent razor bumps and ingrown hairs with a single swipe.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>You can’t use it directly before hair removal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These pads are specifically designed to be used on armpits, the bikini line, and anywhere else you remove body hair.

The star ingredient here is azelaic acid, which can be used to rosacea at prescription-strength levels. It works by gently resurfacing while reducing redness; caviar lime and willow bark help lightly smooth, brighten, and clarify.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A light tingly sensation is normal, but because the formula is non-irritating, most people can use the pads every day. If rosacea makes your skin extra sensitive, start with just twice a week and listen to your skin. If it becomes angry and red, slow it down even more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Azelaic acid, caviar lime extract, willow bark extract｜<strong>Best for: </strong>Dullness, discoloration, enlarged pores｜<strong>Size:</strong> 45 treatments</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-brightening-beautystat-triple-action-one-step-daily-exfoliating-peel-pad></span> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored noskim" data-retailer-type=SKIMLINKS data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" id=product-record__image_1-0-12 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BeautyStat Triple Action One-Step Daily Exfoliating Peel Pad" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sVZSO0ldl-ANbZ0TuBeawsyMfTE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/beautystat-triple-action-one-step-daily-exfoliating-peel-pad-02017c021d2b4c7c99cae9d8d166f146.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This formula is designed to be minimally irritating while delivering a gorgeous glow.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>Because it uses gentler chemical exfoliants, it will take more time to get results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Developed by a beauty chemist, these pads use a comprehensive blend of actives, including niacinamide, antioxidants, and plant extracts, to hone in on uneven skin tone and discoloration. It uses time-released salicylic acid instead of the traditional form, which slowly absorbs into the skin to exfoliate each pore from the inside out and shrinking them in the process. Polyglutamic acid, a humectant, pulls and binds water to the skin to stave off dryness. We love this bonus benefit, considering how drying so many peels can be.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The alpha-hydroxy acid featured in this formula is the gentle lactic acid, as its larger molecule size prevents it from sinking into the skin's deeper layers, like glycolic acid. However, this’ll mean that it’ll take more consistent use over a longer period of time to achieve the results you might be looking for. If you have sensitive skin, though, this peel will be a nice option for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Salicylic acid, lactic acid, polyglutamic acid｜<strong>Best for: </strong>Dullness, acne, discoloration, dehydration｜<strong>Size:</strong> 30 treatments</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dull-skin-songe-glow-to-go-glycolic-acid-peel-pads></span> <a href=# rel="noskim noopener nofollow sponsored" data-retailer-type=AMAZON data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" data-amazon-asin=B01F9OOW1Y id=product-record__image_1-0-13 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Son&amp;Atilde;&amp;curren;ge Glow to Go Glycolic Acid Peel Pads" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tBXf1mP21L_5Bo-xh5hQD1MWmPU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sonage-Glow-to-Go-Glycolic-Acid-Peel-Pads-7c4e56a4d38a43cc95066b298eedb6d3.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>SonÃ¤ge</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The formula is one of the cleanest we’ve ever seen from a chemical peel.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It creates a tingle that new peel users might find disconcerting.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unsurprisingly, chemical peels are not often the cleanest skincare products out there, given the fact that chemicals make up the formula foundation. Yet, we were pleasantly surprised by the extent of this formula's ingredient list comprised mostly of natural, clean actives that still pack quite a punch, starting with glycolic acid to exfoliate and rebalance the skin's surface for a more even complexion. There’s also nourishing coconut milk, soothing lavender oil, hydrating glucosamine, and moisturizing beet sugar to leave skin looking plump and dewy after every use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only drawback is that it leaves skin tingly for a few minutes after use. We actually like this — it makes us feel like it’s working! — but it's not for everyone, and beginners should consider a less intense peel.

It's a hardworking formula comprised of three alpha-hydroxy acids — lactic, glycolic, and citrus — to promote cellular turnover, shedding dead skin cells for a smoother and more even complexion, both instantly and over time. With the addition of hydrating glycerin and conditioning panthenol in the formula, you don't have to worry about the peel stripping your skin of moisture.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You get 60 peel pads in a jar and are supposed to give yourself a treatment once or twice a week.

Each one is saturated with a mix of alpha-hydroxy acids, lactic and glycolic acids, along with the beta-hydroxy acid, salicylic acid, to seriously resurface the top layer of skin and digging deep into pores to leave skin looking firmer, brighter, and smoother. Plus, with the brand's proprietary AlphaRet technology, a lactic acid and retinoid cocktail, your skin will be lavished with anti-aging benefits. “These peel pads are a perfect combination of retinol plus alpha hydroxy acids for mature skin in addressing fine lines and dullness,” says Dr. Mian.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They're undeniably impressive (just check out the brand’s unretouched before-and-after photos for yourself!), but they do come at a price. You’re only meant to use them up to three times a week, so you’ll get around three months of treatment out of one box; you’ll still pay more for these than other treatments on this list.

It features a whopping 20 percent glycolic acid (the highest concentration on this list) to slough away dead skin, delivering instant radiance and smoothing away fine lines while salicylic acid helps clarify pores to combat blackheads. The peels are well sized, so you can use them across your face, neck, chest, hands, and even arms before you’ve used up all the solution.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This peel is powerful stuff — while it does contain lavender and chamomile extracts to help soothe skin, you will still feel a serious tingle when you swipe this one on. That tingle can last for about an hour after use; if you have very sensitive skin, you may notice flushing and pore purging, even if you only use it once a week. We recommend patch testing when using this formula before committing to full-face application as some skin will not be able to tolerate the strength of this peel.

The most common ingredients you’ll find, however, are alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs). “AHAs have a larger molecule than BHAs and help to remove dead skin off the surface of the stratum corneum,” explains Dr. Mian.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Lisa Chevalier, M.M.S., PA-C and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">SoVous Medical Spa and Laser Center</a>, they help to gently disrupt the bonds between the cells in the upper layers of the skin. “As we age, our cells turn over more slowly due to cellular senescence, and a little help from a peel pad can be just the thing to keep that youthful glow and aid in that turnover that makes young skin so smooth, bright and hydrated,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unquestionably, AHAs glycolic and lactic acids are the most popular ingredients found in chemical peels. “They can help brighten the skin's dull complexion, lighten pigmentation, and smooth out skin texture,” says Dr. Mian. You’ll find both in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Universal Daily Peel Pads</a>. They’re not the only AHAs out there, though. Chevalier also recommends AHAs mandelic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, and citric acid, which is often used to adjust the pH of a skincare product while doubling as an antioxidant.

Chevalier adds that it offers antibacterial and antiseptic properties, making salicylic acid an all-star ingredient for treating acne. You’ll find it in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Jan Marini Marini Clear Multi-Acid Corrective Pads</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After AHAs and BHAs, there are PHAs, aka polyhydroxy acids. “These are buzzy new acids that are gentle enough for sensitive skin use,” says Dr. Sobel. In fact, Chevalier says that they’re so gentle that they won’t increase sun sensitivity like most exfoliants and can even be used on clients that have rosacea and eczema. They won’t penetrate as deeply as other acids, but they still can help smooth and brighten the skin. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">StriVectin Daily Reveal ™ Exfoliating Face Pads with AHA + BHA + PHA + TXA</a> features PHA gluconolactone to add an exfoliation boost without increasing the risk of irritation.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those who like “clean” options for exfoliation, consider fruit enzymes. “Fruit enzymes like papaya, pineapple, and grapefruit are excellent exfoliators gentle enough for sensitive skin,” says Dr. Mian. They work similarly to the digestive enzymes in your gut to break down protein, except in this case, it’s breaking down the proteins securing dead skin cells to the surface, gently sweeping them away. You’ll find papaya enzymes in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">ELF SuperGlow AHA Peel Pads</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Other common exfoliators include retinoids, which work more deeply within the skin to promote cellular turnover and can thus help with deeper discoloration and skin laxity, as well as azelaic acid. Though you might think this ingredient is an AHA or BHA, it’s not, though they offer similar benefits. While AHAs and BHAs are derived from ingredients like sugarcane (glycolic acid), milk (lactic acid), and an aspirin precursor (salicylic acid), azelaic acid is a byproduct of yeast. In addition to exfoliating skin, it can help balance the microbiome and reduce inflammation.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Your Skin Concerns + Sensitivity<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With all the chemical exfoliant options out there, it can be a challenge to determine which is right for your skincare needs. When in doubt, start with glycolic acid. “Glycolic acid is a superhero of acids because it works on most skin types, from breakout-prone to mature skin,” says Dr. Sobel. “It is very effective at treating many concerns including acne, scarring, sun damage, and dark spots and hyperpigmentation.” It’ll also make your skin appear more radiant, leaving your skin glowing instantly after use. It also helps to brighten the skin for a more radiant, glowing complexion.

It’ll also help keep the openings of the hair follicles clear to help smooth out the coarse texture created by KP.

But don’t let skin sensitivity keep you from trying chemical peels. “Sensitive skin types should experiment with singular ingredients with products that take longer to penetrate,” she says. And beyond the ingredients you use, keep your usage in mind. “You don't have to use a chemical peel pad every day for it to be effective,” says Dr. Mian. “Those with sensitive skin can start using it once a week, and maybe work their way up to twice a week if the formula is gentle.”<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Strength<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some peels will explicitly list the percentage of the active ingredients used in the formula, which will give you a sense of how powerful it is.

You can also take a look at the ingredient list. “Ingredients are listed in descending order by concentration on the packaging, with the first ingredient having the highest and the last the lowest,” says Chevalier. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">SkinBetter Science AlphaRet Exfoliating Peel Pads</a> features lactic acid as the second ingredient (after water), so you know that this is the most concentrated active in the formula.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even if you’re not using a super potent peel, you’ll want to ease it into your regimen to give your skin time to adjust. Dr. Mian recommends using your chemical peel pad on a night when you’re not using a retinoid and starting your routine with a cream cleanser before going in with the peel. “Follow it with a hydrating serum, like hyaluronic acid, panthenol, or snail mucin,” she says, then “top it off with a moisturizer that has glycerin and ceramides.” This combination of ingredients will help keep your skin comfortable and nourished while helping to avoid too much irritation.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Reducing Irritation<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some sensitivity is par for the course when introducing chemical peel pads to your regimen. “They’re speeding up the process of cellular turnover, which will definitely sensitize the skin to the sun and other active ingredients,” explains Chevalier. Every time you’re using a peel pad, you’re removing a top layer of dead skin, which does offer some protection from external factors, so you’ll be leaving your skin with a weaker line of defense. “The act of the peel pad itself wiping on the skin can cause irritation,” adds Dr. Mian. “I prefer chemical peel pads that are smooth on the surface without ridges.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because peels can also dehydrate the skin, you’ll want to use milkier cleansers, which won’t be as stripping as a gel formula. “Use a high-quality, cleanly formulated hyaluronic serum to flood skin with weightless moisture and keep the skin barrier intact,” adds Dr. Sobel. You should also use a fatty acid- and ceramide-rich moisturizer, which will help protect your skin’s moisture barrier. Lastly, using a physical sunscreen is a must, says Chevalier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Remember, you’ve exposed the fresh, sensitive skin underneath the dead skin to the elements, including UV — and considering so many peels are designed to treat sun damage, you don’t want to counteract all your hard work! A physical sunscreen will sit on the surface of the skin to act as a shield, blocking the sun’s rays without sensitizing the skin. “Chemical blockers are often irritating as they absorb into the skin that may already be sensitized,” says Chevalier.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What do exfoliating peel pads do?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Exfoliating peel pads do exactly what they claim — exfoliate! “They remove skin-dulling dead cells that can cause skin congestion and enlarged pores,” says Dr. Sobel. “They smooth uneven skin texture and can soften the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.” Removing these dead cells can also improve the look of hyperpigmentation.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As dead cells are removed from the skin’s surface, this process will stimulate your skin’s natural cellular turnover. This helps your skin look more radiant and fresh over time — but you’ll also see an instant glow after using an exfoliating peel pad.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>When do I use exfoliating pads?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They’re best used at night because removing dead skin cells with chemical exfoliants can make your skin more sensitive to the sun (so be sure to use SPF in the AM!). Using your chemical peels at night will also be more effective, says Chevalier. “Your skin does a lot of resetting while you sleep allowing for better penetration of products,” she explains. “The temperature of the skin actually increases while you sleep and this causes blood vessels in the skin to dilate and aid in this product absorption.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re wondering how to integrate a chemical peel into a routine that already features a retinoid, Dr. Mian says she uses hers on the nights she’s not using her retinoid. This will help to prevent your skin from getting irritated.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are exfoliating pads bad for your skin?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not at all — they’re quite good for skin health when used correctly. “There are a slew of skin benefits to exfoliating peel pads when used appropriately and in conjunction with proper sun care,” says Chevalier. Adds Dr. Sobel, “they are very versatile, and can be used on the arms, back and other areas where KP or breakouts can occur.” However, if you’re overusing them or using a formula that’s not right for your skin type, that’s a different question. Overuse of chemical peels can result in over-exfoliation, which can leave your skin tender, inflamed, and irritated. If you get to this point, you’ll know it — even basic cleanser or moisturizer can make your skin feel like it’s burning. In this case, you may need to take a break from all skincare products, especially chemical peel pads, until your moisture barrier recovers.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How often should you use exfoliating pads?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A lot of people ask if you can use exfoliating pads every day. The answer to that is “sometimes.” “If the formula is gentle and you have skin on the oily side, you may be able to tolerate a peel pad every day,” says Dr. Mian. In fact, using one with soothing ingredients daily may be beneficial to the skin. However, it’s really best to ease chemical peel pads into your routine, starting with once or twice weekly use.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re new to chemical peels, Chevalier recommends rinsing your skin after use, even if the formula doesn’t say to do so. “Many products can become too irritating if you're using other products that contain active ingredients,” she warns. As your skin acclimates, you can skip the neutralizing step (unless your formula is designed to be used with one!), see how your skin reacts to the peel, and then gradually increase your usage to four times a week. Again, some people may be able to use a peel every day;&nbsp; some peels are formulated to be gentle enough to use them daily.
