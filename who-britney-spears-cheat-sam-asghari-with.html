She’s adamant she didn’t cheat,” the insider said. “The two haven’t got along for a while and it finally came to an end after a major blowup.” Another source noted: “She has been denying any cheating allegations and going through a lot of emotions.”</p><p><a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.tmz.com/2023/08/17/britney-spears-sam-asghari-cheating-house-staff-member-naked-photos/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> reported that sources close to Spears and Asghari reported that Asghari told friends that he thinks that Spears cheated. “Sam has claimed Britney asked at least one staffer to shoot video of her naked, the sources told the gossip site. “Not only that, we’re told Sam believes she hooked up with at least one of the male staff members working at her home.” The sources also claimed that Asghari found footage of Spears with a male staffer in a “compromising position.”</p><p>Meanwhile, sources told<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/britney-spears-and-sam-asgharis-split-was-cheating-a-factor/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Us Weekly</a> that cheating was an unlikely factor in their breakup. “Their friends would be really surprised if Britney cheated and they just don’t see that as a possibility,” a source dished. “They believe there were other issues but cheating wasn’t one of them.”</p><p>“Although things seemed OK on the surface, there was a lot going on behind the scenes. Sam just wasn’t happy and no longer saw a future with Britney,” the source said. “They both wanted different things and they couldn’t come to an agreement on several issues such as having children.”</p><p>Sources also told the tabloid site that during their seven-year relationship that included 14 months of marriage, things allegedly got physical between Spears and her husband. More than once.</p><p>Asghari reportedly told friends Spears had “him a black eye while he was sleeping,” and that he “frequently complained about Britney getting physical with him during their 7 years together. We’re told there have been numerous fights where security has had to step in, but in one instance there was no security in sight,” per insider sources.</p><p>On August 17, 2023, Asghari issued a statement to his Instagram stories regarding their breakup. “After 6 years of love and commitment to each other my wife and I have decided to end our journey together. We will hold onto the love and respect we have for each other and I wish her the best always. Shit happens. Asking for privacy seems rediculous [sic] so I will just ask for everyone including media to be kind and thoughtful.”</p><p>On the other hand, Spears posted a picture of herself on a horse after news broke of their split. In the caption, she wrote that despite all the negativity surrounding her relationship, she’s in the mood for a post-breakup present. “Buying a horse soon 🐴 !!! So many options it’s kinda hard !!! A horse called Sophie and another called Roar 🐎 ??? I can’t make up my mind 🙈 !!! Should I join the camaraderie and put a pink cowboy hat on 😜 ??? Either way I think I found my sweet spot with Roar 😘 !!!”</p><p>In May 2023,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TMZ</a>&nbsp;reported their relationship was “in trouble” before a film documenting her life post-conservatorship titled&nbsp;TMZ Investigates: Britney Spears: The Price of Freedom. “Our sources say Sam doesn’t stay at their home much anymore and it’s especially alarming because of how she has come to rely on him,” the site reported.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfrLWwecGroK2mla56tLzEmqmsZZOdsqLAjKyYpmWRqLSprdGiZLChpJ18</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
