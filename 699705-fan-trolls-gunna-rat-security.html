"'So I can sue the hell out of you' is that not snitching too," one asked. Another wrote: "Grown ass man doing shit like this. Seek gainful employment." Check out the clip below.</p><p>Fans aren't the only ones to call Gunna a rat. Speaking with DJ Akademiks, earlier this year, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lil Durk</a> made similar comments. “That man told," he said at the time.<br>"You should’ve went in there and kept your mouth closed. If you a rat, I fuckin’ hate you. Cause I love Thug.” <a href=# class=text-word rel>Boosie Badazz</a> also told TMZ that he'd turn down one billion dollars to collaborate with Gunna. "I don't want to talk about a rat," he told the outlet. "No, I ain't even gonna say, I might incriminate myself, I don't wanna say it. … I don't wanna incriminate myself, what I would do with a billion dollars. I don't wanna incriminate myself, what I would do to a rat if they gave me a rat to do business with a billion dollars."</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fan-calls-gunna-a-rat>Fan Calls Gunna A "Rat"</h2></span><p>Gunna addressed snitching allegations on a recent single titled, “Bread & Butter." “Fuck I pay the lawyers all those mils for?/ Just so I won’t have to say a word to dodge a railroad…," he raps. "Never gave no statement or agreed to take no stand on ’em/ On whatever you n***as on, then trust me, I’ma stand on it/ Lawyers and the DA did some sneaky shit, I fell for it/ On my Ps and Qs because, this time, I be prepared for it.”</p><p><strong><a href=# rel>Read More: Bandman Kevo Replaces Gunna With A Rat In New Music Video</a></strong></p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmboZ4fJRmnZqmXam%2FsLjLrGSgrZ6jrm6%2BwK1krJ2Tqr%2BqwNg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
