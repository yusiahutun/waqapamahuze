It was terrible.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=73 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Celebrity attendees at the ceremony–other than George and Amal Clooney—include Meryl Streep, Matt Damon, and Jimmy Kimmel.</p><h2 data-node-id=74 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">October 2009: They make their first public appearance together</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=75 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Blunt and Krasinski make their first public appearance together as a couple, only a mere few months after their engagement, at the 16th annual Women in Hollywood Tribute hosted by Elle.</p><img alt="16th annual elle women in hollywood tribute inside" title="16th Annual Elle Women in Hollywood Tribute - Inside" width=2161 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/actors-emily-blunt-and-john-krasinski-attend-the-16th-news-photo-1709233369.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Shearer</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=77 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For the event, Blunt wears a strapless nude mini dress with a belted bow around the waist and a set of matching strappy heels.

(If it was anything like Krasinski’s proposal while playing Jim on The Office, we bet it was romantic.)</p><h2 data-node-id=83 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">January 2009: They get chummy at the SAG Awards</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=84 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although they arrive separately, both Krasinski and Blunt attend the 2009 SAG Awards, and the pair are seen getting chummy backstage, like in one photo where they laugh during a conversation with Sean Penn.</p><img alt="tnttbs broadcasts the 15th annual screen actors guild awards backstage and audience" title="TNT/TBS Broadcasts The 15th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards - Backstage and Audience" width=3000 height=2127 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/actors-sean-penn-john-krasinski-and-emily-blunt-backstage-news-photo-1709232800.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Lester Cohen</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=86 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">November 2008: Emily and John meet at a restaurant</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=87 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Prior to their connection, Krasinski was in a relationship with his Office co-star Rashida Jones. Meanwhile, Blunt had been dating Michael Bublé for a few years, until they separated in 2008. That fall, while Krasinski was dining at a restaurant, he was introduced to Blunt by a mutual friend.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=88 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Blunt recounts the story during a visit to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU8qwXYH83c&feature=emb_title" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Late Night with Seth Meyers" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Late Night with Seth Meyers</a>, where she says, “It's kind of a sad, lame story. I was in a restaurant, he was in the restaurant. I was sitting with a mutual friend, and my friend Gray goes ‘Oh my god, that's my friend John.’ And that was it. He was sitting with our friend Justin Theroux, and he abandoned Justin and came over to us. He just stood there and made me laugh.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=89 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/john-krasinski-emily-blunt-talk-biggest-year-1169307/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the two argue about who asked who out first. “Probably me, I think,” Blunt says, before Krasinski counters, “Yeah, right.” The two go back and forth for some time until Krasinski says, “It was me asking for a while and you took some time, and then we finally had a date.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=90 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But despite whoever actually asked for the first date, the pair ended up having pizza at Krasinski’s apartment in West Hollywood, and the rest was history. When speaking of evening, the pair choose to keep some details to themselves though, as Blunt teases, “It’s so precious, I don’t want to talk about it. Is that all right?”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/04e4fe03-f532-4e6a-8cd4-455131aa4449_1702400410.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Joel Calfee" title="Headshot of Joel Calfee" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Joel is the editorial and social media assistant for HarpersBAZAAR.com, where he covers all things celebrity news.
