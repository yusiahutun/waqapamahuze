Buckle up, because it’s about to be a volatile and turbulent ride.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">second to last eclipse of 2023</a> is upon us, and the Nodes of Destiny continue to transit the Aries-Libra axis. The most basic polarity between “me vs. we,” this astrological axis has everything to do with the self, and how one projects themselves out into the world. While Mars-ruled Aries represents our identity and levels of assertion, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Venus-ruled Libra</a> speaks about the relationships we commit to, and allow ourselves to merge with. In the meantime, be sure to check where these cardinal energies come to life in your birth chart.</p><p>Eclipses are powerful moon phases that usher in life-changing events. Whether it be a brand-new beginning or an unexpected ending, consider this a cosmic push from the heavens… or better yet, divine intervention. Not to worry, each calendar year has a minimum of four eclipses so, rest assured, you’ve been down this road before. This month’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new moon solar eclipse</a> will take place on October 14 at 1:55 p.m. ET, and via 21 degrees of justice-seeking Libra. (If you find eclipses to be intimidating, you’re not alone; this astronomical phenomenon was regarded as a negative omen in the ancient world, but it all stems from mankind’s fear of the unknown.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-13.png><p>Although there are always spiritual implications to an eclipse, there’s a scientific basis behind it all. “An eclipse takes place when one heavenly body such as a moon or planet moves into the shadow of another heavenly body,” according <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to NASA</a>. That is why a solar eclipse is equivalent to a powerful new moon; the only exception being that instead of the sun and moon joining forces with one another, it occurs when the moon moves between the sun and the earth. This particular eclipse, however, is considered an “annular” solar eclipse, which is when the moon doesn’t fully cover the sun. This, in turn, leaves a thin outer ring which is referred to as a “ring of fire.”</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>The new moon solar eclipse in Libra takes place on October 14 at 1:55 p.m. ET.</p></figure><p>Astrologically, it’s important to note that October’s solar eclipse will be sitting close to Mercury, and the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>South Node in Libra</a>. This adds a layer of mercurial energy to this mix, which is insightful, thought provoking, and perhaps even collaborative. Venus (the eclipse ruler) is currently transiting Virgo, a sign where the planet of relationships is considered to be “in detriment.” As for its close proximity to the South Node, the journey we’re collectively and individually embarking on (between now and the next six months) will require a significant amount of release. Reflect on the dynamic of your connections, partnerships, relationships, negotiations, and ability to compromise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-20.png><p>How do you share your energy with others? What’s no longer in alignment in this area of your life? The South Node can resonate with what you experienced in the past decade, so think back to the years 2014 and 2015 (when the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">North Node was in Libra</a>, and the South Node was in Aries) as it could serve as a prelude of what you can expect throughout this eclipse story. What have you discovered about yourself, and your relationship experiences since? How has your perception of yourself and others evolved in the process?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-solar-eclipse-will-affect-each-zodiac-sign>How the Solar Eclipse Will Affect Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming solar eclipse in Libra, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">your sun sign</a> and/or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8827258320127><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>The inner-workings of your relationship dynamics are brought to the forefront under this solar eclipse. But with the North Node of Destiny transiting your Mars-ruled territory, it’s your turn to call the shots. The solar eclipse will also be sitting close to chatty Mercury and the South Node in Libra, highlighting everything from your commitments to the relationship energies that no longer serve your highest good.

Do they bring you joy? For those of you cultivating a talent or skill, are you maximizing your potential? Whether personally or professionally, this could be top of mind with October’s new moon solar eclipse, especially with Venus in Virgo lighting up your fifth house of authenticity and self-expression. It will also sit close to Mercury and the South Node, putting a spotlight on the root of your current commitments, specifically those no longer serving you. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.2967032967033><h2>Gemini</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gemini.png><p>If you’ve been consciously or unconsciously holding back from sharing your gifts with your community, and/or for the greater good, you’re being called to take a closer look at your personal commitments, and get clear on whether they’re worth compromising for. The solar eclipse will conjunct your celestial ruler, Mercury, as well as the South Node in Libra. Both of these energies are occupying your heart-centered fifth house of children, self-expression, and passion projects. If it’s not making you happy, it’s time to let it go. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.3615269461078><h2>Cancer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cancer.png><p>People-pleasing isn’t productive when it’s time to take the lead. However, in order to find the strength to take a stand, there’s a need to go inward and be discerning with your emotions. October’s solar eclipse will touch down on your emotionally driven fourth house of home, family matters, and innermost feelings, and all while sitting in close proximity to Mercury and the South Node.

October’s solar eclipse is charging up your third house of communication, mindsets, and immediate surroundings, and all while making a conjunction with Mercury and the South Node in Libra. Also, with Venus in Virgo, themes surrounding your comfort, confidence, values, and self-esteem are top of mind. Nevertheless, after gaining insight (thanks to Mercury) during this eclipse, you may come to find the root of your fears, and insecurities.

October’s solar eclipse will conjunct Mercury and the South Node, bringing pivotal information that could bring awareness to what needs to be released.

October’s new moon solar eclipse will ignite your sign, and all while sitting close to Mercury and the South Node. Venus is also in Virgo, highlighting your unconscious patterns and life behind the scenes, specifically what’s no longer serving you.
