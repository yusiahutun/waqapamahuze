The fire began on Saturday and is responsible for destroying approximately 43 homes and 42 outbuildings, according to initial reports published by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Central Oregon Daily News</a>. Over 2,000 acres have burned, and hundreds of Klamath County residents have been evacuated.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>The Sisters-Camp Sherman Fire District in Oregon rescues dog.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Sisters-Camp Sherman Fire District</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Amid the mayhem comes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a beautiful story</a>. Firefighters from the Sisters-Camp Sherman Fire District reunited a lost pooch with its loved ones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We sent [an] engine to Bly along with the Central Oregon Task Force. While they were working, Fire/Medic David Ward found Ladybird wandering around, apparently lost," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a Facebook announcement </a>from the agency began. "They clearly became fast friends! Our crew took care of her, while doing their work, until she could be reunited with her family. Thankfully she had a phone number on her collar that helped to make contact."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Sisters-Camp Sherman Fire District shared several images of Ladybird, including one with the rescued canine kissing Ward. In the other photos, Ladybird appears happy and healthy as she jumps on firefighters and receives pets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Low fuel moisture, 90-degree temperatures, and wind gusts up to 20 mph contributed to extreme fire behavior," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>the Golden Fire Facebook official page</a> stated yesterday about the Golden Fire.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Our hearts go out to the Bonanza community and those affected by the Golden Fire," Matt Howard, ODF Team 2 Incident Commander, said. "We grieve with the community and your loss. Our goal on this fire has been, and will continue to be, to contain this fire to minimize its impact. Our job now is to fully suppress this fire so the recovery process can begin. That is our commitment to you."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>The Sisters-Camp Sherman Fire District in Oregon rescues dog.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Sisters-Camp Sherman Fire District</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ladybird's happy ending is similar to another pup who was recently rescued. Matt was taken in by the South Plains Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) in Lubbock, Texas, this month. The canine was given his name after he was discovered with his fur badly matted to his body. Tori Houston, a foster and volunteer with the South Plains SPCA, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>spoke exclusively to PEOPLE</a> about how she met Matt.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I first got the call, these people had found this dog behind their house in a cornfield, and I got a call by my president [Kim Moyers] to go pick this dog up," Houston began. "And when I arrived, the condition of this dog was probably the worst I had ever seen any dog, ever; he had so much hair you didn't know which was the front, which was the back. He was covered in goat heads. He stunk so bad. You couldn't see any part of his body. He looked like a pile of sheep wool."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block"></h3><p><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a></strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">South Plains SPCA president Kim Moyers told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>KLBK-TV</a>, "His hair growth was about five years of matting. It's just awful that he was probably seen in different places and overlooked. I don't see how he hasn't been seen roaming in the condition he was. I've never seen anything like him. It was shocking."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thankfully, three pounds of fur was removed from Matt's tiny body. "After we had one of our professional groomers — who's also an SPCA foster — groom him, he looked amazing. He is the most gorgeous-looking dog I've ever seen. He's just drop-dead gorgeous," Houston confirmed, adding that Matt is now recovering and preparing to find <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a loving place to call home</a>.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5%2Bnsqi7zWadoqqVm7aotNOeqWaqlaiwtrGMnaagZaKawq%2B1055kqZ2kYsSqwMdmnZqlmaHGboOUb2xrb2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
