In fact, it’s actually doubled since then.</strong></p><p>Ever since leaving the <a href=#>royal</a> family in 2020, <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> stopped being working royals and went on to embark on their own ventures. This included their bombshell <a href=#>Netflix</a> documentary, and the Duke writing his memoir Spare, to name a few. The Duchess is also gearing up to start her lifestyle brand, <a href=#>American Riviera Orchard</a>. Although Harry has gotten a lot of stick from those back home in the UK, it looks like he hasn’t suffered, at least, his bank account hasn’t.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-1490796993-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-s-net-worth-has-skyrocketed-from-2017-to-now>Prince Harry’s net worth has skyrocketed from 2017 to now</h2><p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle first met in July 2016, when he was 32. Meghan is three years his senior and was 35 at the time.</p><p>In 2017, the year after they met, the Prince’s net worth was estimated to be $37.3 million (£30 million) according to The Richest. Both he and <a href=#>Prince William</a> gathered most of their wealth on their 30th birthdays, which included an inheritance of $16.1 million (£13 million) in trust and estate from their late mother <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>.</p><p>By 2018, the Richest <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> both brothers had a net worth of $34.8 million (£28 million).</p><p>In 2019, the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> were well and truly settled together, and as the former <a href=#>Suits actress</a> came in with a net worth of $5 million, together, the pair were worth an estimated&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$45 million</a>.</p><p>Cut to 2022, everything was starting to return to normal after the pandemic, and the Sussexes were settled into their <a href=#>new life in California</a>. “I’ve got all my mom left me, and without that we would not be able to do this,” Harry told Oprah about their new life.</p><p>Their company, Archewell Productions, signed a deal with Netflix that was estimated to be around $100 – $150 million. Although the Duke’s memoir was released in 2023, it was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> by Page Six that he received an advance of $20 million.</p><p>They also signed a $20 million deal with Spotify, however, one author claimed they were<a href=#> only given a portion</a> of this.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-duke-s-net-worth-has-doubled-since-2017>The Duke’s net worth has doubled since 2017</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-498823108-1024x748.jpg><p>After all the ups and downs, it’s now reported the couple are worth $60 million, almost double what Harry was worth in 2017.</p><p>Meghan’s net worth has also vastly increased since marrying her husband, as the pair now share their money and often take on projects together.</p><p>After marrying into the family, she received a 91-piece jewelry collection worth $747,000 (£600,000). And it doesn’t look like her net worth will be declining any time soon. With the release of the lifestyle brand American Riviera Orchard just around the corner, it looks like the only way is up for the Sussexes’ bank accounts.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2aCcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2Kxkp52kYsSwvtOhZKGZo2KxsMHBpZydZZmjeqvB0q1kmmWWmsRuxcSaqaxlkaOxbrTEZpqapl2ptaK6ymaknp%2BYlrtuucCroqWdXZu8s3nToZitZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
