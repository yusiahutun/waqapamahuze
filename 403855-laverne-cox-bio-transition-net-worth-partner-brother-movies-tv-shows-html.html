First, she attended the Alabama School of Fine Arts for her high school studies.</p><p class=align-left>Later, she proceeded to Indiana University Bloomington, where she majored in dance. Finally, she switched to Marymount Manhattan College to pursue acting.</p><h3>Gender transitioning</h3><p class=align-left>Laverne Cox before transition experience was, not the best. In third grade, she was nearly injected with testosterone to make her more masculine than feminine. Deep down her heart, she wanted to be a female, which her mother did not approve of at first.</p><p class=align-left>Like Caitlyn Jenner and Andreja Pejic, she openly spoke about her transition. In many instances, she was offended by people who misgendered her even when she wore a dress and braids. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">thought of transitioning</a> crossed her mind in her late teenage years.</p><p class=align-left>She once posted a photo of her before undergoing the sex reassignment procedure in 2016 alongside an emotional caption.

But underneath a lot of overcompensating, I didn't feel cute. I felt the opposite of cute. People misgendering me, calling me a man and saying I looked like a man got to me and made me feel so insecure. It kept me from seeing myself clearly and loving what I saw. I look back on this young woman and want to give her the love I didn't know how to back then. It's not too late. #TransIsBeautiful.<p class=align-left>The transition process began when she moved to New York for higher learning. She met Tina Sparkles and many other trans women who inspired her to start the process. At last, she was able to become the woman she had dreamed of for years.</p><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>Laverne Cox has proven that transgender people can also have successful careers like others.
