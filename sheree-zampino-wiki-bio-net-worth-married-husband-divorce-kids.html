However, our marriage ended because we were so young. We were the same age then that our son is right now. It’s just a lot of responsibility. Marriage isn’t easy, especially at that age. Will was becoming bigger and bigger with his career. I’m becoming smaller and smaller. I just didn’t have the tools. We didn’t have the tools to make it work. I left because I was unhappy. It’s really that simple.”</p><p>Here’s the video :</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Kids</strong></h2><p>Two unsuccessful marriages from Zampino produced two children.
