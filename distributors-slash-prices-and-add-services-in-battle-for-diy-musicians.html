It’s billed as a limited-time offer but is part of a growing trend that sees DIY music distributors slashing prices and adding free services in order to compete.</p><p>Tunecore recently shifted from per release pricing to unlimited releases starting at $14.99 a year, and full-service distributor Symphonic, which normally charges label and artist clients 10-15% of revenue, just launched Symphonic&nbsp;Starter, offering DIY artists unlimited releases for $19.95 per year with no additional commission.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp><h4>The DistroKid Effect</h4><p>Most other DIY and independent distributors are also joining this race to the bottom, fueled in large part by the success of DistroKid.</p><p>DistroKid serves more than 2 million artists and is said to distribute more than 35,000 new tracks every day, or about one-third of all the new music in the world. It has kept its prices consistent at $19.99 a year for unlimited releases and competes by adding new free and low-cost services.</p><p>Most distributors offer a variety of free and paid add-ons in their bid to attract users.</p><p>CD Baby also adds strong educational resources and community with its DIY Musician conference and ongoing webinars and blog posts. But CD Baby faces a pricing challenge that its top two competitors, Distrokid and Tunecore, do not. While CD Baby’s sign-up fee is one-time rather than annual, it charges a 9% commission on all revenue that the other two don’t.</p><p>For full-service distributors like Symphonic, offering a lower-price alternative is more about attracting future success stories than fighting for DIY market share.</p><p>“There are many providers of DIY distribution, but when we looked closer, we found that the offerings at the intro pricing levels are very limited,” said&nbsp;<strong>Jorge Brea, Symphonic Founder & CEO</strong>. “Indie artists need all the help they can get… I know because I was a new indie artist back in 2006, and I still produce music today.”</p><h4>Switching Distributors Can Be Tricky</h4><p>Attracting early-stage artists is also critical because of a built-in bias against change.</p><p>Switching from one distributor to another can be tricky and lead to music being unavailable anywhere for days or even weeks. So once an artist picks a distributor, the tendency is to stick with them.</p><p><strong>Bruce Houghton</strong> is the Founder and Editor of <a href=#>Hypebot</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>MusicThinkTank</a>&nbsp;and serves as a Senior Advisor to&nbsp;<a href=#>Bandsintown</a>, which acquired both publications in 2019.
