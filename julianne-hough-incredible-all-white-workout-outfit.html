In the video, Julianne hits a squat, explodes up, and throws up her arms. Two other workout participants stand behind her with one woman wearing an equally enviable white sports bra and high-waist leggings with cutouts in the legs.&nbsp;</p><p id=eSSB5lUIuwHX data-wc=46>Although Julianne didn’t mention who the workout set was by, it looks very similar to Alo Yoga’s athleisure ensembles that she wears often - and that we love too. The star’s sports bra looks almost like Alo Yoga’s Peak bra, which is <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>sold out everywhere in white</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=eZyx5G0MmiHy data-wc=30>It’s <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>still available in black</a>, but we found a similar white version on Amazon for less than $20 below. We also found an Alo Yoga version of Julianne’s leggings in a cropped variety.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/740bbeceb546-white-sports-bra-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eVJ1XUaLt-SO data-wc=4>Cutout sports bra, $18.99, <span><a aria-label="white sports bra" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Amazon</a></span></p><h6 dir=ltr style=text-align:center><span><a aria-label="white sports bra" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ba3288d44351-alo-leggings-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e3nbDSh2FX_2 data-wc=5><strong>High-waist Mesmerize capri leggings, $88, <span><a aria-label="white leggings" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Alo Yoga</a></span></strong></p><h6 dir=ltr style=text-align:center><span><a aria-label="white leggings" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><p id=eSLCk5O4bkJ7 data-wc=59>“The new <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>@kinrgy</a> site is up and ready to go!

The health and wellness aficionado&nbsp;previously chatted about the meaning of the brand's name&nbsp;on her Instagram Story, saying that she wanted it to reflect the "collective."&nbsp;</p><p id=eiF9_CKort7A data-wc=34>"The whole point is that we want you to join in and have your own transformational journey of growth and opportunity and excitement," she said, adding that transformation can happen “physically, mentally, or spiritually".</p><p id=e5EvuNwzKZp7 data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Julianne Hough turns heads in crop top and hot pants</a></strong></p><p id=eAB0XJ-t8oHw data-wc=50>Julianne’s affinity for attractive workout gear like the set she’s wearing in her Instagram post led her to design her first athleisure collection with MJG Sport in 2017. In a recent interview with Health, the professional dancer told the magazine&nbsp;why creating her own athleisure collection was important to her.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8d8dbcadcd3c-julianne-hough-red-workout-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eZAHAWnH2nUI data-wc=7><strong>Julianne stuns in a red athleisure&nbsp;look</strong></p><p id=ecm9IF0TrwKO data-wc=76>“I lived with a bunch of models when I first moved to Los Angeles, and they were always dressed to the nines, and I was always in my dance gear,” Julianne <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>told Health</a></strong>. “I thought, 'I feel like such a shlub.' Nothing was really cute that I could go to the movies in or go to Target in or to dinner with the girls. But I was always dancing. So I needed to blend the two worlds.”&nbsp;</p><p id=e3yJN2c45pnn data-wc=36>“I wanted the line to be authentic to me, so I made sure there was a little bit of dance feel to it,” she continued. “I wanted it to feel almost sassy and a little sexy.”</p><p id=erB2cVfLtlju data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Julianne Hough shows off her dancer's body in tight workout gear</a></strong></p><p id=e_KyP1xYsxs9 data-wc=70>As for what keeps her in incredible shape, Julianne swears by "moving" every single day, whether that is dancing, hiking, spinning, or something else. But it's not just her workouts that keep her lean and in tip-top condition. It’s her diet and plenty of sleep too.&nbsp;"Your workout is just one part of staying healthy," she shared with Delish. "The rest is sleeping and what you put into your body."</p><p id=eIioPD4APY0g data-wc=12>It’s clear Julianne’s hard work - and discipline - has paid off.&nbsp;</p><p style=font-size:12px id=e5T3dk8SQ-QW data-wc=41><a class=hm-link href=#>FAQ page</a>.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
