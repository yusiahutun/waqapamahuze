They didn’t confirm their wedding guests before their breakup. However, it was expected that most of of the&nbsp;Summer House&nbsp;Season 8 cast would be invited. The main cast members for&nbsp;Summer House&nbsp;Season 8 included returning cast members Kyle Cooke, Amanda Batule, Paige DeSorbo, Ciara Miller, Danielle Olivera, and Gabby Prescod, as well as new cast members Jesse Solomon and West Wilson. The cast also included part-time cast members Sam Feher, Mya Allen, and Chris Leoni, as well as guests Kory Keefer and Andrea Denver.</p><p>In an interview on&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live&nbsp;in April 2023, Lindsay revealed that she wasn’t sure at the time if she wanted to invite Danielle—her former best friend whom she had a falling out with over Danielle’s concerns about Lindsay and Carl’s fast relationship—to her wedding. “I guess we’ll find out after the reunion,” she said. Lindsay also told host Andy Cohen that she was “hopeful” for a resolution between her and Danielle.</p><p>“As far as public[ly] mending our friendship, I think the challenge is that we haven’t really seen each other,” Lindsay said. “From what I’ve heard, she is working through some things in her personal life, and we’re planning a wedding, so I think that just, right now, we’re just on different paths.”</p><p>Danielle reacted to Lindsay’s hope for their relationship in her own interview with&nbsp;The Daily Dish. “I mean, it’s awesome to hear her say that, of course. But actions speak louder than words, especially in a public forum,” she said.</p><p>Danielle continued, “I’m going through a lot in my life right now, and it would be great to have her,” Danielle said. “But I think I’m going to leave it in her court, because I think I’ve done enough on my end. I’ve said what I needed to say. Time will tell, but I haven’t heard from her, so that, I think, says a lot.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfqMKuucSrZKGnpaiybr%2FEmqqopl1teqSt0q1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
