From <a href=#>Elton John</a>’s “Rocketman” and <a href=#>Aretha Franklin</a>’s “Respect” to <a href=#>Elvis</a>’ eponymous film, some massive stars have had their stories told on the big screen.</p><p>Of course, one of the most important parts of a celebrity biopic has to do with the starring role -- and who will fill the shoes of the movie’s subject. And when it comes time to cast the film, these celebrities often get a say on who will play them on screen. Although not all celebs are guaranteed a movie about their lives, many have definitely had some fun brainstorming who would get the part!</p><p>Here’s what these celebrities had to say about their future biopics…</p><p><strong>1. </strong><a href=#><strong>Halsey</strong></a></p><p>Halsey doesn’t have a biopic about their life in the works just yet but they’ve already got the lead role planned out. They say that <a href=#>Millie Bobby Brown</a> would be perfect for the job, considering they often get told they look alike. Halsey even dressed up as Millie’s character Eleven at one point!</p><p>"Millie would be so great. I mean, it’s kind of uncanny how much we look alike. It’s like, oh no, we actually just look like sisters," Halsey said on "<a href=#>The Tonight Show</a>."</p><p><strong>2. </strong><a href=#><strong>Drew Barrymore</strong></a></p><p>Drew Barrymore recently revealed on <a href=#>TikTok</a> that she believes <a href=#>Joey King</a> would be the perfect actress to play her in a movie about her life. She didn’t expand on why she’d pick Joey but in the rapid fire video, she did note that the actress is also probably the most "surprising celeb" in her phone.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a6659145-badc-4308-b016-5679b17d0ed6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:3b391a46-d7cf-41c5-bccb-97d4dcedfca0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/07/5by4/2022/11/09/07b131d6e097400fb1495a3378e3584c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty/Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Britney Spears Weighs in After Millie Bobby Brown Talks Biopic of Her Life: 'Dude I'm Not Dead'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>3. </strong><a href=#><strong>Jennifer Hudson</strong></a></p><p>Jennifer Hudson took on the role of Aretha Franklin in her biopic but when it comes to a movie about her own life, Jennifer says she would cast <a href=#>Skye Dakota Turner </a>in the starring role.</p><p>"The only person I can think of is little Skye who plays young Aretha. I think by the time my film ever comes along, she would be the perfect age. So I would have to say her so far," Jennifer told <a href=#>Access Hollywood</a>.</p><p><strong>4. </strong><a href=#><strong>Hillary Clinton</strong></a></p><p>Hillary Clinton says that if she were to cast a biopic about her life, her longtime friend <a href=#>Meryl Streep</a> would be her top choice to play the starring role. The politician went on to praise Meryl, saying that the actress could easily "play anybody, anytime, anywhere." When Meryl heard about Hillary’s suggestion, she was grateful but a little unsure about taking on the role.</p><p>"I think that’s very lovely of her to say but then she might not be happy with the result!" Meryl jokingly told <a href=#>Extra</a>.</p><p><strong>5. </strong><a href=#><strong>Niall Horan</strong></a></p><p>Back in 2013, Niall Horan was asked who would play him on screen in a One Direction origin film and he said it would have to be <a href=#>Tom Felton</a>. Although Tom may be too old to play a teenager now, he said he was totally willing to take on the role at the time.</p><p>"Of course. What’s really sweet is the rest [of the band] said <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a>, <a href=#>Leonardo [DiCaprio]</a>, and Niall said, Tom Felton…It’s very flattering and I’m a big Directioner," Tom told <a href=#>MTV News</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5f7b5a12-c087-423f-b66d-86cd6b48783f data-container-ref=toofab:article:3b391a46-d7cf-41c5-bccb-97d4dcedfca0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/60/5by4/2022/07/24/60e68f3237a94aa9a61f52c45c0045ff_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">After Liam Payne's Claim 1D Was Built Around Him, X Factor Releases Unseen Video of Group's Formation</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>6. </strong><a href=#><strong>Will Smith</strong></a></p><p>Will Smith has portrayed plenty of real-life people on screen but when it comes to someone else playing him, he’s not sure who would take the role. Despite the age difference, Will says he would probably choose his friend Denzel Washington<a href=#>.</a></p><p>"Denzel’s older than me now so Denzel wouldn’t be able to play the young me but that’s who I would want," Will <a href=#>shared</a>.</p><p><strong>7. </strong><a href=#><strong>Dolly Parton</strong></a></p><p>Dolly Parton has recently been discussing <a href=#>making a musical biopic</a> about her life and she might already have a lead actress lined up. Back in 2014, she shared that she had been talking with <a href=#>Reese Witherspoon</a> about playing her on screen. While Dolly was unsure at first, she says that Reese’s confidence convinced her she would nail the role.</p><p>"Reese Witherspoon is a dear friend of mine…We were talking about my life story, and I went, 'Well people always say to me, 'Why don't you get Reese Witherspoon [to play you].’ And I always say, 'Her boobs ain't big enough! I think she's too little to rag this around! I wouldn't put that on her.' But Reese said, 'Well, there's padding, I've got enough to do it!' I said, 'Well, we're [talking] about it,’" Dolly said on "<a href=#>Lorraine</a>."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7da36b5e-c099-40c1-b652-25056423e996 data-container-ref=toofab:article:3b391a46-d7cf-41c5-bccb-97d4dcedfca0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8a/5by4/2022/01/27/8a36db23a07d482faf7f1f690c85ccc2_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Dolly Parton Sets the Record Straight on Rumor That Her Breasts Are Insured</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>9. </strong><a href=#><strong>Anne Heche</strong></a></p><p>Before Anne Heche’s untimely passing, she revealed that she would want either <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> or <a href=#>Kristen Bell</a> to portray her on screen. Anne explained that she believed that "those two girls" had the ability to "pull off the humor that I have" while also doing justice to "the journey that I’ve gone through."</p><p>"Miley Cyrus or Kristen Bell! I’ve already thought about it…The two of them share a personality ability to face the world the way that I would want, that I feel like I have and would want portrayed," she said on the "<a href=#>Behind the Velvet Rope</a>" podcast.</p><p><strong>10. </strong><a href=#><strong>Miles Teller</strong></a></p><p>Miles Teller says that after meeting <a href=#>Oscar Isaac</a>, he believes the actor would be a good fit to portray him in a biopic. He also joked that if Oscar isn’t up for the role, he could always turn to Christopher Walken.</p><p>"I just met Oscar Isaac and I think Oscar and I kind of have a similar quality going on so I’d say him. Or <a href=#>Christopher Walken</a> just so I could see a version of me but with his panache on there. Would be very cool," Miles told <a href=#><u>Vanity Fair</u></a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:76be2cf9-cfe8-447b-b96d-dd290bb25861 data-container-ref=toofab:article:3b391a46-d7cf-41c5-bccb-97d4dcedfca0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/55/5by4/2022/07/11/55f7e05e0ccd43148cc9600914addd5b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Paramount</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Miles Teller Says He's Had 'Conversations' With Tom Cruise About ANOTHER Top Gun Movie</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>11. </strong><a href=#><strong>Gladys Knight</strong></a></p><p>Gladys Knight has been thinking about who would play her in a biopic for quite some time and says she always comes back to Kelly Rowland. On several occasions, Gladys has said that she thinks Kelly would be great for the role.</p><p>"I like Kelly Rowland. We don’t know her as an actress but there’s something about her and her spirit that kind of reflect with me. And I think that’s going to be important to anyone who may take that role. It’s not just about saying the things I said then, it’s about feeling the things that I felt during those times," she told "<a href=#>CBS Mornings</a>."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:410557d3-f916-54aa-8fa4-65c36167f197 data-container-ref=toofab:article:3b391a46-d7cf-41c5-bccb-97d4dcedfca0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/eb/5by4/2018/10/10/eb373bb8aa09546eb394dec25871ec73_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Aretha Franklin Honored at AMAs -- Gladys Knight, Cece Winans and More Gospel Legends Pay Tribute</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGpma2xfmLKtscGsZKudppqurXnWoaZmrJiaxm7DwKerZqyfYr2trdhmq6GdnWK2r3nBoqapoZOofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
