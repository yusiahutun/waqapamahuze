Mango! Fruit & Yogurt Gummy Candies were a favorite item for many shoppers who loved the <a href=#>fruity taste</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/trader-joes-store-princeton-new-800995137.jpg><p>This is why it came as such a shock when the item was discontinued some time ago - but the pain still lingers for many fans, including Morgan (@<a aria-label="MorganHasCringe (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MorganHasCringe</a>).</p><p>Morgan, who claims to have previously worked for <a href=#>Trader Joe's</a>, shared a video with her more than 1,000 <a href=#>TikTok</a> followers, expressing her frustration that the treat was taken off store shelves.</p><p>In <a href=# aria-label="a quick clip (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">a quick clip</a>, Morgan used a lyric from the 1971 song American Pie by <a href=#>Don McLean</a>.</p><p>"The day the music died," McLean could be heard singing in the track.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE TRADER JOE'S">READ MORE TRADER JOE'S</h2><p>However, instead of "died" Morgan wrote "discontinued" in the video's onscreen text overlay along with a mango emoji.</p><p>"As an ex- #traderjoes #crewmember, these being discontinued was THE worst thing that ever happened," Morgan wrote in the caption of the TikTok.</p><p>She wasn't the only one upset as some users over on the Trader Joe's <a href=#>Reddit</a> thread were just as saddened by the loss of their beloved gummies.</p><p>"Where is the Mango Mango gummies? Are they a seasonal item?" a user wrote.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>"They have sadly been discontinued," replied another user.</p><p>This sparked a wave of comments from other users - some who weren't even aware the snack was discontinued.</p><p>"No! Whyyyy! Those were my favorite treat!" wrote one person.</p><p>"Nooooo I didn’t know they got discontinued," wrote another person. "They were one of my favorite snacks."</p><p>According to one user, the recipe was changed to make the gummies vegan-friendly just a few months before they were removed.</p><p>A user said this change "ruined" the treat.</p><p>"They were awful I'm sure that's why they were discontinued," the user wrote.</p><p>"I’ve been looking for them for a while. I’m glad they discontinued them though after they switched the recipe because the gummies were disgusting after it went to a vegan product," wrote another person.</p><p>"Super unfortunate because they were so good before the recipe change."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/former-crew-member-says-worst-824149543.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbYB1fZNpbWisopaxpr6Mo6aeq12ZtrSvzqeroqalmrFuucCnnqhll6q6rrXErGSsoJ%2Blvaa%2B0masqauVqXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
