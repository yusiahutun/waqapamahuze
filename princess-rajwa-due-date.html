According to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://twitter.com/Gertsroyals/status/1778016562101780641 rel=nofollow>Gert’s Royals on X, </a>the baby will have His/Her Royal Highness titles. “If the baby is a boy, he will be 2nd in line to the throne. (The Jordan Constitution allows the Monarch to appoint a brother an heir, instead of eldest son. So, the baby could technically get bypassed, but not likely).”</p><p>In an&nbsp;interview with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Vogue Arabia</a>&nbsp;published in May 2023, Crown Prince Hussein revealed how he met his wife. “I met Rajwa through an old friend from school.

She also has a professional designation degree in visual communications from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles.&nbsp;Crown Prince Hussein is a graduate of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in England and Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.</p><p>The Royal couple married on June 1, 2023.
