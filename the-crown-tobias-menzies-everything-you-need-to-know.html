His mother was a teacher and his father a producer at the BBC. The 45-year-old studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), however, he didn't always want to be an actor. In a previous chat with Interview magazine, Tobias revealed that when he was a child he used to play tennis competitively and wanted to become a professional player. "That was what I was nuts about, what I used to dream about," he said. "The brutal truth was I probably wasn't quite good enough."</p><p id=ekWjaN1fVwTI data-wc=66>It wasn't until he attended RADA that he eventually caught the acting bug after initially enrolling to study theatre production and dance. "When I got to RADA, I was surrounded by a lot of people who had wanted to be actors since they were yay high and by the time I left, I'd really caught the bug for acting, the bug for straight performance," he added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8c77778ab423-the-crown-tobias-menzies-z.jpg><p id=er-2AxLIChYj data-wc=9><strong>Tobias stars opposite Olivia Colman and Helena Bonham Carter</strong></p><h2>Which TV shows has Tobias Menzies been in?</h2><p id=e7GI96ZerQIS data-wc=97>Tobias' first job out of drama school was on BBC One medical drama Casualty.

Speaking about how he prepared for the role, he previously told the Evening Standard that he did look to past seasons to pick up on Matt's "mannerisms and intonation", but mainly utilised archive footage of the Duke of Edinburgh to prepare. "He was less mannered when he was younger, much less of a Spitting Image puppet," he said. "In the Nineties and 2000s he became a more extreme version of himself."</p><h2>When does The Crown season three air?</h2><p id=etot74_zzvfm data-wc=20>You can watch every episode of season three of The Crown on Sunday 17 November when it drops on Netflix.</p><p id=eTb6CPVg8oXQ data-wc=14><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#> Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get other stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2pxYWZ%2BdoSPbnBxZ6Sdsm6v0aiup2WkpK%2BqrdJmpJ6mqp6ytHnEr5yrsaSdtq%2BzjLKmrmWemrKledOoZKSmn6x8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
