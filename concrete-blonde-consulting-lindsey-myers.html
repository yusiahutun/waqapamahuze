Most organizations understand the importance of public relations to frame marketing strategies and improve the company’s reputation. Public relations are all about sending the right messages to the right places and the right people. Public Relations help to increase brand credibility, which is the most important factor for the growth of a company.</p><p>Lindsey is a communications expert and entrepreneur; Lindsey Myers has over twelve years of experience serving various industries including consumer products and services, tech, lifestyle, hospitality, and non-profit companies in NYC and the Hamptons luxury market. After graduating from Boston University with a BS in Communications and concentration in PR, Lindsey Myers began Lindsey Myers’s career at WordHampton Public Relations, a firm headquartered in East Hampton, NY and ranked by Jack O’Dwyer’s as one of the country’s “Top 100 Independent PR firms”.&nbsp; In 2013, Lindsey Myers made partner and was chosen to launch the company’s NYC division.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Foundation-</strong></h4><p><strong>Lindsey Myers</strong> founded <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Concrete Blonde Consulting</a></strong> in November 2016 to pursue Lindsey Myers’s passion for building reputations and revenues through business development marketing strategies. Concrete Blonde Consulting is a full-service consulting and marketing firm in NYC.

Then we create bespoke strategic marketing plans with benchmarks to chart our progress and target our methods.&nbsp; We feel a sense of responsibility to our clients and we are responsive not only to their needs, but also to the ever changing world in which they operate.”</p><p>Starting from zero, building everything from the ground up was a pretty challenging task. Also, a lack of funds and the need to bring clients immediately posed a challenge. But once the clients were on board, what helped was getting to know their vision and helping them determine their goals before we get started.&nbsp; This allows us to benchmark tangible goals for success and hit KPIs.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Services-</strong></h4><p>Concrete Blonde Consulting offers its services in the following sectors-</p><ul><li>Media Relations</li><li>Strategic Visioning</li><li>Media Training</li><li>Social Media Management</li><li>Crisis Communications</li><li>Content Development</li><li>Social Influencer Campaigns</li></ul><p>The biggest differential is the Concrete Blonde Consulting’s team.</p><p>&nbsp;“We’re fortunate enough to have amazing talent – they’re creative, resourceful and highly responsive.”&nbsp;</p><p>The company is currently working on dinner series which they will launch next quarter – that idea was driven by the desire to add value for their clients.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Concrete Blonde Consulting Family-</strong></h2><p>The vision the team works with is that the door is always open. No one is punished or made to feel ashamed of the mistakes they commit. As it is said, ‘To err is human’. Lindsey says, “I might be in charge, but I made logic the boss – I welcome people disagreeing with me and/or being resourceful and finding a better way to do something.&nbsp; I don’t micro-manage.”</p><p>Getting past your fears is important in the journey of life.

Or what we can call constant vigilance, and it is a need! The best entrepreneurs all have one thing in common – they love what they do, it’s always on the forefront of their mind, they are constantly looking for ways to do it better and they put in consistent effort.&nbsp; There is no such thing as an overnight success and with how fast the world is changing, if you don’t change with it and adapt, your company will die very quickly.</p><p>“It’s a rat race out there. I try to stay out of it entirely. Just do your thing and take advantage of the opportunities that come my way.&nbsp; And I surround myself with people who have a positive attitude and see win-win solutions to every problem.&nbsp; People get trapped in the “rat-race” by buying to the false belief that for one person to succeed another person has to fail.” Lindsey Myers’s leadership and expertise have earned her numerous accolades throughout Lindsey Myers’s career including; PRSA Big Apple award, PRSA Bronze Anvil Award, eight MarCom awards, nine Fair Media Council Folio Awards, Communicator award, SABRE award, and an Excellence in Communications award.</p><p>For recent and latest updates regarding business news, industry trends, etc. Please subscribe Newsletter from “<a href=#>The Enterprise World</a>” at “Subscribe“&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZLCwusKrnK2dXZe5sLrDnmScp56owq3AyKeeZqSZo7G0sdhmpLKdoqg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
