Being anywhere near an altar with Madison. Wow, OK.”</p><p>To make matters worse, <a href=#>the “Pillows and Beer” podcast cohost</a>’s new flame, <a href=#><strong>Olivia Flowers</strong></a>, brought a new man, Zach, as her date for the puppy nuptials, which irked him. The North Carolina native jokingly called Olivia’s guest, “Lumberjack chic” based on his outfit, before claiming <a href=#>he was fine with her seeing someone else</a>.</p><p>Olivia, for her part, was pleased as punch about her date choice. “Considering this is my first official blind date, I am pretty pleased with what I am seeing so far,” the 30-year-old reality star told the cameras. “I think he’s very handsome. So far so good.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Paige DeSorbo</strong></a>, who attended the event with her beau, Craig, pointed out that a dog wedding isn’t exactly normal. “It’s a Charleston thing,” <a href=#>the Delaware native</a> explained, but Paige, 29, shot back, “No, this is some rich people s–t. This is nicer than my wedding is going to be.”</p><p>Despite being confused by the formal event, <a href=#>Paige and Craig enjoyed their day out</a> until Naomie, 29, got a little too involved in their relationship.</p><p>“Y’all, somebody give Paige your jacket. Craig, give her your jacket. Paige, you need a jacket,” Naomie said before the wedding, noting that the <a href=#>Summer House</a> star was not dressed warm enough.</p><p>While Craig eventually gave Paige his coat, he was mad that his ex-girlfriend, <a href=#>whom he dated for three years before their 2017 split</a>, inserted herself in the matter.</p><p>“What is going through Naomie’s head where she thinks she knows what’s best for me and my girlfriend?” the Pillow Talk author said during a confessional. “I don’t think she’s getting it. <a href=#>This is not respecting boundaries</a>.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Southern Charm airs on Bravo Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>Scroll down to relive the most explosive moments from season 8, episode 8:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BovLbAx56pp2WTna6zudJmmK6rpJq7brnAnaCsp55iuqax02aYrWWRocGivoycqZqhl2KvrbvWrGSuqF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
