To start, the Mercury cazimi in Cancer on July 1 brings our communication planet in perfect alignment with the sun. This conjunction is supported by abundance-loving Jupiter, so expect big ideas and glittering revelations. Two days later, an enlightening <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">full moon in Capricorn</a> inspires us to manifest these fresh ideas into the tangible realm. This lunation is supported by lucky Jupiter and responsible Saturn, so use the lunar magic to build a solid foundation under your goals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/fullmoonleozodiac.png><p>Our energy levels and communication flow shift a bit mid-month, once powerhouse Mars and chatty Mercury change signs. Mars enters detail-oriented Virgo on July 10, motivating us to get our lives organized and pour more energy into our wellness for the remainder of the month. Later that day (or the early the following day, for those of us on eastern time), Mercury enters Leo, inspiring us to communicate with more confidence and express our ideas without second-guessing ourselves.</p><p>A week later, on June 17, we have an emotional yet empowering <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>new moon in Cancer</a>. The sun and moon will be facing off with <a href=#>power-hungry Pluto in Capricorn</a>, forcing us to walk through the flames of our shadow sides before we can be fully renewed. However, this lunation reminds us that our vulnerability can also bring us strength, so open your heart to finding unexpected sources of power.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=0.75757575757576><p><a href=# id=auto-tag_venus-retrograde data-tag=venus-retrograde>Venus retrograde</a> in Leo begins on July 22 and ends on September 3.</p></figure><p>On the same day as the new moon, <a href=#>the fate-wielding North Note</a> and <a href=#>karmic South Node</a> enters Aries and Libra—a shift that’ll usher in a new era of life-altering eclipses relating to our identities and relationships. As we kick off this transit and move into the final third of the month, the Nodes find themselves in a powerful Grand Cross with mysterious Pluto and the illuminating sun. We’re digging deep beneath the surface, preparing to act on our core goals and purge the tension that’s been holding us back from aligning with our true selves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/venusinleoaffecteachzodiac.png><p>Leo season kicks off on July 22, which is always a great time to embrace joy, creativity and pursue things with passion. Leo is ruled by the sun, so our cosmic star is shining extra bright in its regal and flashy home sign. On the same day, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>love planet Venus</a> begins retrograding in Leo, kicking off six weeks of review, revision and re-do’s in matters of romance, money and more. The following day, sensitive comet <a href=#>Chiron begins retrograding in Aries</a>, giving us a chance to heal old wounds. Combined with Venus retrograde, this is a good time to work on finding closure in painful past relationships or or situations that have slashed our confidence.</p><p>We wrap things up with some much-needed mental clarity, as logistical Mercury enters practical Virgo on July 28. This transit blesses us with a fantastic eye for detail and helps us to express ourselves with more precision and care. Virgo is one of the communication planet’s home-base signs, so Mercury’s quickness and cleverness is especially easy to access during these final days of July, and it’s great for social and work matters alike.</p><p>Read on for your full horoscope for the month of July <a href=# id=auto-tag_2023 data-tag=2023>2023</a>, according to <a href=#>your sun sign</a> and/or <a href=#>rising sign</a>:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-planets-will-affect-your-zodiac-sign-this-month>How the Planets Will Affect Your Zodiac Sign This Month</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>The North Node of Destiny enters your zodiac sign on July 17.
