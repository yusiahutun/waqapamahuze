Many of them have witnessed our growth, so I think they keep us in their hearts like their school memories.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/30/49963657-1743-4b3e-a379-c359900fd855_5344eda4.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shinee debuted on May 25, 2008 as a quintet – Onew, Jonghyun, Key, Minho and Taemin – with the EP Replay. The lead single, “Replay”, is called “Noona You’re So Pretty” in Korean.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Noona is a Korean word used by a male to address a female who is older, but of a similar generation, to him.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">2nd-gen K-pop boy bands Infinite, Shinee and Teen Top making comebacks</span></p></a></h3>The act promoted themselves as a band of youths and won the hearts of female fans who were, for the most part, older than the members. <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Taemin, the youngest</span></a>, was 14 when he debuted. Shinee became the talk of the town for their fashion, characterised by colourful skinny jeans, prompting a buying spree among teenagers.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their first full-length album, The Shinee World, hit shelves three months after their debut. Fronted by lead track “Love Like Oxygen”, the album won Newcomer Album of the Year at the 23rd Golden Disc Awards, a major music awards ceremony in Korea.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since then, the group have dropped a string of hits, including “Ring Ding Dong” in 2009.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Well-known for its repetitive refrain, “Ring Ding Dong” took streaming charts by storm at home and abroad. It used to be “banned” in high schools as it would get stuck in the heads of students taking their university entrance exams and distract them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/30/86478413-4678-4233-903d-5ddc580c79ec_e18049fa.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The group dropped “Lucifer” in 2010 and “Sherlock (Clue+Note)” in 2012. The latter is known for its challenging choreography crafted by internationally acclaimed choreographer Tony Testa.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Sherlock” is a mash-up of two tracks, “Clue” and “Note”, and is often thought to be K-pop’s first hybrid remix. The attempt to fuse the new jack swing and hip-hop elements of “Clue” and the vocal-driven character of “Note” was hugely successful, and Rolling Stone magazine named it one of the great boy band songs of all time in 2015 and in 2020.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2015, Shinee staged their first solo concert at the Tokyo Dome, the biggest baseball stadium in Japan’s capital city. After the show, they continued to experiment with their sound, releasing “View” – considered K-pop’s first venture into deep house.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Thanks to these feats, Shinee have become one of the few K-pop acts that are both commercially and artistically successful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/30/3cdc8585-e713-4f8c-a749-87468724c4d8_595de0ff.jpg>Onew, the oldest member, started his compulsory military service in 2018, as did Minho and Key in 2019.

They held a special event with fans in Seoul on May 27 and May 28.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Onew has hinted that the coming album will signal a new chapter in Shinee’s career, adding that the pursuit of difference is the defining characteristic of Shinee.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Key said: “We will not rest on our laurels and continue to proceed.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLhuvM6pZpuZnpnAcK3RraCcpJVkgHN%2BkWtwa2ebYr2wvIygqaitoGLAqbXNnpxmpZGgsm6vzqacm5mToHpzfJFsZGptXa6yor7SZpifrJWneqWxwa6rZqeemsRuwMSaqp6rXaOyuHnApZmupV2YvK%2BvxKmrZqyRmrqquoysmLKr</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
