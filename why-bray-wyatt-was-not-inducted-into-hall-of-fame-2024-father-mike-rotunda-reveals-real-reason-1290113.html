He was best known for his creative storylines and innovations in the world of professional wrestling.&nbsp;</p><p>WWE fans highly expected that WWE would induct Bray Wyatt into the Hall of Fame 2024 class. But WWE did not induct Bray Wyatt into the class of Hall of Fame 2024. Instead, they&nbsp;inducted the father and uncle of Bray Wyatt, Mike Rotunda, and Barry Windham into the Hall of Fame 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, while talking to SportsKeeda, father of Bray Wyatt, Mike Rotunda expressed his views on WWE not inducting Bray Wyatt this year and the possible reason behind it.</p><p>Mike Rotunda said, “With Windham passing, I thought they were gonna immediately put Windham into the Hall of Fame, which he will be in at some point. I think WWE reassessed stuff and thought it was too soon to go there with our family and the reactions and the stress on us.” <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>“We got a call from WWE and they said Hunter wanted to do a Zoom call. We were thinking they were gonna tell us what was gonna happen at WrestleMania and Hunter said, ‘You guys are gonna get inducted. You and Barry were a part of the first WrestleMania show. It’s very flattering obviously and actually less stressful on us because of all the stuff that we had to go through with Windham passing, just the mental capacity of it.”</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><br><h2 id=66045a56bb3a2>The Reason Behind Bray Wyatt’s Death</h2><p>Bray Wyatt’s death shocked all those WWE fans out there. Windham made his anticipated return a year before his death at WWE Extreme Rules 2022. His last wrestling match came at Summer Slam 2023 against LA Knight in a pitch-black match.&nbsp;</p><p>After Bray Wyatt’s death, on behalf of Wyatt’s family, Fightful reported the real reason behind Bray Wyatt’s sudden death.</p><p>“ I was permitted to reveal that earlier this year Windham Rotunda Bray Wyatt got COVID exacerbated heart issues. There was a lot of positive progress towards a return and his recovery. Unfortunately today he suffered a heart attack and passed away” revealed a report by Fightful.</p><p><img alt="Image Courtesy : YouTube " title="Image Courtesy : YouTube " width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-03/1711560357_maxresdefault-2024-03-27t102541-829.jpg></p><h2 id=66045a56bb3ac>List of WWE Hall Of Fame Inductee’s 2024</h2><p>WWE conducts a Hall Of Fame ceremony on the night before WrestleMania and honors the business legends who contributed to the rise of the WWE company.
