One that seems to be particularly popular among CEOs, singers, and actors is the one meal a day diet a.k.a OMAD.</p><p>You’d think that being a Hollywood royalty would mean days filled with munching on scrumptious food and washing it all down with the finest of drinks. However, these celebs who eat one meal a day attribute their tip-top health to mostly eating dinner only. Curious who these people are? Check out a few of them below.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jack Dorsey&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2022/11/jack-dorsey.jpg><p>Founder of the popular social platform Twitter and online payment service, Square, Jack Dorsey said that once he started eating a meal a day, he was surprised at how much time in the day people generally spent on meals.</p><p>The billionaire revealed that he only eats dinner and this usually consists of a protein, vegetables, berries, and tops it off with a dark chocolate dessert. Interestingly, he claims to never eat anything on the weekends and satiates himself with water only.</p><p>Not many of us can survive on water alone, especially over the weekends, way to go, Dorsey!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Channing Tatum&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2020/07/Channing-Tatum-687x1024.jpg><p>This Magic Mike XXL superstar is all kinds of delicious! Going by his ripped abs and perennially young looks, you would think that his source of subsistence is small portions of ‘rabbit food’ consumed throughout the day.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, the hunk is actually into what would be considered unhealthy stuff, which includes pizza, burgers, sweets, and peanut butter sandwiches laden with copious amounts of grape jelly. According to Tatum, ‘<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">life is too short to miss out on the beautiful things like a double cheeseburger.’</a></p><p>Lucky for him, he limits his feeding routine to just one meal, which he manages to squeeze in the middle of the day or at dinnertime.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Montel Williams</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2022/11/Montel-Williams-691x1024.jpg><p>Best known for his popular talk show, The Montel Williams Show, the former host, motivational speaker, and 61-year-old actor has been on a very stringent diet for years now since being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1999.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of his intense fitness-focused lifestyle involves him eating just one meal a day, mostly a lean protein. The rest of the day, he drinks up to 48 ounces of water.&nbsp;</p><p>Williams also uses medical marijuana to support his fitness goals, and he has even introduced his own CBD product, “Lenitiv.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pippa Middleton&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2022/11/pippa-middleton-779x1024.jpg><p>Sister to Prince William’s wife, Kate Middleton, is totally #bodygoals. Besides the British public’s fixation on the lass’s rear end, Pippa has an incredibly enviable physique in part due to the Sirtfood routine.</p><p>Sirtfood combines elements of intermittent fasting and OMAD dieting. The general requirements of this routine include eating a meal a day while keeping the caloric intake to 1,000 in the first three days of beginning the program and then upping the intake to 1,500 in the remaining four days of the first week.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Middleton, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sirtfood diet helped her shed weight in preparation for her wedding</a>. She revealed that her once-a-day meal includes a variety of choices, including sweet potatoes, quinoa, lentils, and plenty of brown rice. If breakfast is her meal of the day, her go-to is rye roast and porridge.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brooke Shields</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2022/11/brooke-shields-686x1024.jpg><p>When we talk of ageless beauty, Brooke Shields is among those who come top of mind. The 55-year-old actress and mother of two <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">admits that working out and staying fit is a struggle</a> and wanting to eat and drink is a very real impulse.&nbsp;</p><p>The Blue Lagoon star says that she has to work her ass off to maintain her lean physique and youthful looks. In the past, she revealed that with her hectic acting career, she only eats one meal a day. While on set, she tries to keep this one meal to just breakfast because the rest of the day, she is constantly moving, and as she stated, eating at night can ruin your vocal cords.</p><p>It isn’t clear whether Shields observes the OMAD routine when she is not working but going by the fact that she talks a lot about intermittent fasting, it would be safe to say that this is something she does on the regular.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chris Pratt&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2022/11/chris-pratt-683x1024.jpg><p>Christ Pratt, star of the Guardians of the Galaxy movie franchise, has been encouraging fans to look into intermittent fasting, a routine that he says helped him stay fit for his movie role.&nbsp;</p><p>The actor says he takes his only meal of the day beginning at noon and squeezes in coffee at some point in the day to keep him going. He admits that the routine’s worked for him and that he has even lost some weight as a result.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jennifer Aniston&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2020/07/jennifer-aniston-one-meal-a-day-1024x614.jpg><p>Jennifer Aniston’s trainer Tracy Anderson once caused a stir when she claimed that her famous client was able to shed some weight using the Baby Food Diet. The celebrity trainer is said to have put <a href=#>Aniston</a> on a routine consisting of 14 servings of baby food and a healthy meal for dinner.&nbsp;</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>, the actress said that she does not eat any food in the morning and goes for 16 hours without eating, only sitting down to eat at dinner time. She complements her dieting with yoga and a five-times-a-week workout routine.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chris Martin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2023/08/chris-martin-coldplay-fasting-665x1024.jpg><p>Coldplay’s charismatic frontman, Chris Martin, has a secret up his sleeve, and it’s all thanks to rock legend Bruce Springsteen. In a candid chat with Conan O’Brien, Chris dished out that he’s been skipping dinner and wrapping up his meals by 4 pm.</p><p>Why, you ask?</p><p>Well, after a lunch date with Springsteen, Martin couldn’t help but notice The Boss’s impeccable shape at 73. Taking cues, he adopted the one-meal-a-day mantra. And while he playfully hinted at Springsteen’s diet being a buffalo flank with some “special” sauce, the real deal is a disciplined diet. And hey, if it’s good enough for The Boss, it’s good enough for the “Fix You” singer!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Gary Lineker</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2023/08/gary-lineker-fasting.jpg><p>From the football pitch to the TV studio, Gary Lineker has always been in the spotlight. But have you ever wondered how the former footballer maintains his athletic physique?</p><p>Well, the secret is out! In a chat with the Evening Standard, Lineker spilled the beans on his fitness regimen. Not only does he hit the gym for at least three intense sessions every week and indulge in Pilates, but he also follows a ‘one-meal-a-day diet’. That’s right! Gary skips breakfast and munches on some nuts and fruits in the evening if he’s had lunch or during the day.</p><p>Eating one meal a day is a bit controversial in the medical and nutrition community. Still, we can’t deny that these celebrities are looking pretty good, whether that’s in part due to limiting their meals to once a day or adopting an intense workout routine</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmraCVqLJur8SlnJuqmam2pr%2BMnpitZZ%2Bjsm65xJqjZpldma66ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
