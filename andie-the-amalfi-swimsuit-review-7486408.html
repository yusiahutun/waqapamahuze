We had agreed to make this a totally relaxing getaway, full of lounging in the sun and resting, so I knew we’d be spending lots of time waterside (AKA, I would likely wear swimsuits the most). So, like any wise traveler with limited luggage space, I tried on all my swimwear before folding them into my carry-on to ensure they A) looked good and B) could double as clothes in case we decided to do a last-minute outing. I relied on some oldies — like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>my go-to Cuup two-piece I recently waxed poetic about</a>, and some newbies, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the famous Andie Amalfi one-piece</a> that looked so good the second I put it on, I gasped.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I don’t have that reaction often when I try on swimwear. I’ve come to accept that 99 percent of the one- and two-pieces I buy will have at least some detail that I’m not crazy about. The butt-coverage isn’t perfect, the leg-opening is too high-rise for my liking (think ‘80s-era Baywatch), the straps aren’t adjustable, the fit just isn’t it. So all this considered, what I’m about to say is even more jaw-dropping: I loved every single thing about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the Amalfi</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I had known about this swimsuit for years. It kept selling out, and because I’m keen on buzzy products, it was always on my radar. Eventually, Demi Moore modeled it in a campaign for the swimwear brand, which made it all the more elusive. But when I booked my Miami trip, I finally said, “Now's the time to try it.” And I’m so glad I did; in fact, I don’t think I’ll be wearing any other one-piece for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Andie</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$98; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">andieswim.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The fit is incredible. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">It’s basically like shapewear</a>, but suitable for oceans and pools. When I put it on, the material snatched and smoothed my body in all the right places — and that’s just one major plus of this one-piece. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">The flat fabric variety</a>, the one I own, is made with a compressive lining and has a four-way stretch that’s equal parts flattering and comfortable. It also hugs my curves in ways no suit has before. When I put it on, I didn’t want to take it off — and that’s perhaps the biggest compliment ever. Aside from the aesthetic, the material also has a practical benefit: It has UPF 50 protection.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Other things I so deeply appreciate about this suit include the adjustable straps, medium butt coverage, medium-cut leg that doesn’t ride up, and removable cups that give my small boobs a nice lift. I also love that the Amalfi is available in various fabrics; as I mentioned, I have the smooth option, but there’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a ribbed material</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the brand’s limited-edition prints</a>, some of which are on sale.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As if the fabric options weren’t enough, you can also get this suit in two torso-lengths: a classic and a long torso. I went with the latter option, as my torso is on the longer end, which also makes buying suits a struggle because most standard picks end up fitting in an unflattering way. The long option ensures that the suit doesn’t ride up or dig, meaning the fit is truly *chef’s kiss.*&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a cherry on top, the Amalfi also has some celebrity fans, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Mindy Kaling</a>, who wore the red iteration during a recent poolside lounge, and Moore, who looked so stunning, she could easily convince even one-piece haters to try it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">TL;DR? It’s no wonder this suit always sells out. I just got mine, but I'm already considering adding more colors into my rotation. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Shop it for $98</a> and get ready to gasp the second you put it on.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Andie</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $98; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">andieswim.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wKebop1dqbWmecCmmKWemWLAuLXMrKyirF2nsre1xLBkcGxoa4FxhA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
