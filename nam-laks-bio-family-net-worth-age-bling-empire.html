But whilst almost all of them had made something of themselves, our star, Nam Laks was still depending on her dad to get whatever she wants.</span></p><p><span>Yet she was affectionately referred to as “The Blair Waldorf of Thailand.”</span></p><p><span>However, her extravagant lifestyle might soon be coming to an end as her father was thinking of cutting her off upon graduation if she didn’t stand on her own two feet in New York — the other alternative was to return to Thailand.</span></p><p><span>For those who missed the drama&nbsp; Nam’s decision to shop for dresses even though she didn’t necessarily “needed” them, was the last straw for her father. As featured in ep 2, she and Vika Abbyaeva go shopping for dresses during a break between her university classes. There, she tells Vika, “It’s fine, my daddy will pay,” when it came to the bill. But after the shopping spree, Nam’s brother told her “After graduation, Dad said you’re on your own, Nam”&nbsp; and also added that their father would “cancel her card” as she “spends too much.”</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Nam Laks?</b></h3><p><span>Nam Laks was 28 years of age when she appeared on </span><i><span>Bling Empire: New York</span></i><span> in 2023.</span></p><p><span>She was the second younger cast that season — the youngest being Vika Abby (27 then).</span></p><h3><b>Nam Laks Family</b></h3><p><span>Nam Laks comes her an affluent Thai family.
