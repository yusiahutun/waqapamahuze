This I've learned the hard way through several years of recreational racing in sneakers that were first designed for men and then graded down to women's sizing. Those sneakers brought me everything from minor foot irritation to blisters and knee pain that made me want to quit running, point-blank-period.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Running shoe designs that focus on women's feet shapes and fits are still relatively new from established activewear giants; even rarer are brands that emphasize fits for women at the outset. So I was intrigued—and once again on the hunt for new running shoes—when fit-first, women-led brand <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://join-hilma.com/pages/the-mission data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Hilma data-vars-ga-product-id=f891c8fd-d083-4ea4-b0c1-fc6fc388682e data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://join-hilma.com/pages/the-mission data-product-url=https://join-hilma.com/pages/the-mission data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjoin-hilma.com%2Fpages%2Fthe-mission" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=join-hilma.com data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=913c2bdd-922a-4835-8d5a-957e7d8453a4 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=join-hilma.com class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Hilma</a> launched in 2022 after three years in development. Founded by ultramarathoner Brooke Torres and backed by sneaker execs with a combined fifty years in design experience, Hilma has one of the most diverse sizing options in the running shoe market. It offers 45 sizes with three differing widths and toe-box shapes, all modeled off women's feet (and rigorously tested by women runners pre-launch).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Within this wide range of sizes, Hilma claims, women runners can find shoes that are more precisely engineered for their feet and suited to runs of all distances, on all terrains. Naturally, I had to test them myself.</p><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Hilma The Everywhere</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$159 at join-hilma.com for The Everywhere" data-href=https://join-hilma.com/ data-product-url=https://join-hilma.com/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjoin-hilma.com%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$159 at join-hilma.com" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://join-hilma.com/ data-vars-ga-product-brand=Hilma data-vars-ga-product-id=38fab172-a60d-41bc-8f81-1bcdea91e843 data-vars-ga-product-price=$159.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=f6b3ca99-664d-4a91-bb50-85068dd4dfad data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=Hilma data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Traditional & Vocal Pop" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="The Everywhere" title="The Everywhere" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1678720002-copy-of-hilma-mirage-grey-diagonal-view-png-640f3b49854cd.png width=2000 height=2000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Hilma The Everywhere</h2></p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Credit: Hilma</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I've spent the past three months running exclusively in Hilma sneakers while preparing for a 5K race (in February) and a half-marathon (in April). The shoe that worked best with my foot shape was Hilma's sneaker in "The Two," the middle option of the three foot molds that has a semi-wide toe box, in my standard running shoe size (a women's 10).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The moment I started running in my Hilmas, I could immediately feel a difference. The sugarcane-based midsoles are springy and light, but not at the expense of comfort inside the shoe. Traction from the slightly lugged soles helped me keep my balance when training runs coincided with light rain and slick, slippery paths.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">These are also the most secure running shoes I've ever worn. From my first easy jog around Central Park at the start of my training plan until my final sprint on race day, they've always hugged my foot without feeling overly snug or uncomfortable. (I especially love the cushioned tongue—irritation along the top of my foot has been a pain point in other sneakers, but not these!) I've worn my share of running shoes that promise a "lighter than air" bounce in the soles—but fail to mention the ankle blisters that come from their uppers or an unwieldy, out-of-control feeling while wearing them. In Hilma's case, discomfort hasn't been part of the equation, and I have a calibrated size and fit to thank.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Overall, I didn't notice how many concessions I'd made to wear okay running shoes until I tried great running shoes. Like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a38667880/pepper-bra-review/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="bras catered to specific sizes" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">bras catered to specific sizes</a> and precisely tailored jeans, a specific fit in a sneaker eliminates any discomfort or fidgeting so you can feel good in what you're wearing and focus on moving your body. Every time I left the house to run wearing Hilma, I could keep my pace and feel confident in their support. I'll caveat that I haven't run more than six or seven miles at a time in my Hilmas, but I'm optimistic that their performance level will hold up for longer distances.</p><img alt="a model wears a pair of hilma sneakers and black leggings while walking on a trail to illustrate a hilma running shoes review 2023" title="Hilma Running Shoes Review 2023" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hilma-editorial-4-640f3c32450cf.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Hilma</span><p>Hilma’s running shoes have grippy, durable sole for trail running (or walking).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The highly specific, running-first design is simultaneously Hilma's biggest pro and a very small con. I have a minor allergy to bright colors but I like incorporating sneakers into my everyday outfits. Hilma's teal and lavender shades gel better with my black <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/g25908766/best-leggings/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=leggings class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">leggings</a> and sports bras than the neutral, oversized suits and sweater dresses I wear most often outside of my workouts.

And for a runner who's cycled through dozens of styles in search of the perfect racing pair, that's a luxury.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Just two weeks ago, I hit two personal records in my winter 5K race while wearing my Hilmas: one for a single mile and one for the race overall. I didn't have to stop to adjust, or even think about, my sneakers for any of those three-point-one miles. That's the sign of a great running shoe: one that doesn't make you compromise, physically or mentally.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hilma's running shoes are exclusively available on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://join-hilma.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=join-hilma.com data-vars-ga-product-id=a40c8752-8e79-4427-9b79-464e3dca8d45 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://join-hilma.com/ data-product-url=https://join-hilma.com/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjoin-hilma.com%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=Hilma data-vars-ga-product-price=$159.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=f6b3ca99-664d-4a91-bb50-85068dd4dfad data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=Hilma data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Traditional & Vocal Pop" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">join-hilma.com</a>.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Halie LeSavage is the fashion commerce editor at Harper's BAZAAR.
