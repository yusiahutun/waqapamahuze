According to Netflix's <a href=#>website</a>, the crew run into a snafu during their hunting trip when they encounter a flock of sheep.</p><p>In 2020, Combs appeared in a post on Rinella's Instagram, leading fans to speculate that the singer might be a guest on a forthcoming episode. <a href=#>In a tweet</a> he shared&nbsp;last Wednesday (Sept. 29), Combs confirmed his appearance on the show, and also shared some snapshots from the trip.</p><p>Combs also said that the Brothers Hunt, songwriter/conservationist sibling duo Dan and Reid Isbell, also joined him on his voyage to Wyoming for the MeatEater shoot. Just a few days after sharing the news of his appearance on the episode, Combs <a href=#>offered fans a snippet of a new song </a>called "The Kind of Love We Make," which he co-wrote with&nbsp;the Brothers Hunt as well as Dustin Nunley and Jamie Davis. It's unclear if the song was written during their trip to Wyoming or on another occasion.</p><p>The singer also donated a signed acoustic guitar to be auctioned off as part of MeatEater's "Auction House of Oddities," benefiting their<a href=#> Land Access Initiative</a>. The initiative raises money to find more hunting properties and create opportunities for people everywhere to hunt and fish. Bidding on the guitar signed by Combs runs through Oct. 18; you can place a bid on MeatEater's <a href=#>website</a>.</p><p>Part 1 of the new season of MeatEater is now streaming on Netflix. Other episodes bring Rinella and his celebrity guests to a South Texas ranch, on a muleback venture through the Ozarks, and much more.</p><p><strong>PICS: See Country Stars With Their Famous Friends</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpa2bmnqku8ybqmallZbBpq3TnqlmnaCewLCwxGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
