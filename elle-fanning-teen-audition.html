I didn't get it. I don't even think they ever made it, but it was a father-daughter road trip comedy," she began. "I didn't hear from my agents because they wouldn't tell me things like this — that filtration system is really important because there's probably a lot more damaging comments that they filtered — but this one got to me."</p><p>"I was 16, I was literally 17 years old, and this person said, 'Oh, she didn't get the father-daughter road trip comedy because she's unf---able,'" Fanning then claimed, getting a "Whoa! At 16?!" out of Ralph, who sat beside her.</p><p>"Yes. It's so disgusting. There are so many stories like this," said Fanning, who has compared notes with her counterparts in the industry.

I don't feel like it damaged me, but it definitely made me very aware of myself," she said.</p><p>Lyonne then shared a disturbing experience of her own from her Hollywood beginnings, claiming that when she auditioned for a "Lolita" remake as a 14 or 15-year-old actress, she was asked, "Can you eat this banana slowly?"</p><p>"And I was already a bit of a tough guy, so I was like, 'So you mean eat the banana slowly?' But it's sick," she continued.
