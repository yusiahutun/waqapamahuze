As in previous footage, the pair appear to have a perfect existence in Barbie Land ... until an existential crisis strikes and the two head off to the "real world."</p><p>Barbie starts questioning everything after a series of unfortunate events start happening to her -- including a cold shower, a fall from her roof and, worst of all, being saddled with flat feet.</p><p>As she sets out on her journey of self-discovery, Ken sneaks along for the ride ... and, soon enough, the two find themselves in Los Angeles, a place where Barbie gets sexually harassed and the pair wind up in jail.</p><p>The trailer promises that the movie is both for people who love and "hate Barbie," something Robbie herself acknowledged in a recent interview with Vogue.</p><p>"We of course would want to honor the 60-year legacy that this brand has, but we have to acknowledge that there are a lot of people who aren't fans of Barbie," she told the outlet. "And in fact, aren't just indifferent to Barbie. They actively hate Barbie. And have a real issue with Barbie. We need to find a way to acknowledge that."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>The new sneak peek ends with a tease for the movie's soundtrack as well, including a sample of Aqua's "Barbie Girl."</p><p>The full soundtrack will feature songs from Nicki Minaj, Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Ava Max, Charli XCX, HAIM, GAYLE, Khalid, Ice Spice and, yes, even Gosling himself.</p><p>Lipa's single, "Dance the Night Away," is also featured in the trailer and will be released Friday. The movie, meanwhile, hits theaters July 21.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25ma21fl66zrsieZKSdnmKus77ErKuenF2pv6K1y56pZpmhqq5ursCrmaKdXZy2s7iO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
