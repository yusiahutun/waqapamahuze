But let’s not forget the giveth part of the equation: There are still great Christian movies on Netflix to enjoy, and more are sure to be added in the future.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Movieguide</a> website reports that “the audience for faith-based films has grown, particularly among Christians,” and that “streaming platforms and independent studios have paved the way for some of Hollywood’s biggest names to create their own content. Stars such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mel Gibson</a>, Mark Wahlberg and [<a href=#>This Is Us</a>’] <a href=#>Chrissy Metz</a> have either taken on roles or directed films that are faith-based.”</p><p>“I want this movie to help people regain their faith,” Wahlberg noted of Father Stu during a Fox News interview, adding that it was one of the most important projects of his career. “This film especially has touched so many people and reminded them what life is all about.”</p><p>With stars of his caliber and a growing track record of Christian-value films being more and more profitable, expect for more options of Christian movies on Netflix very soon.</p><p>In the meantime, here are some Christian movies on Netflix you can dive into right away.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Best Christian movies on Netflix, ranked</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>12.

The book and story, which tackle women’s struggles with infertility, “teaches a solid moral lesson that explains the importance of patience. It shows that regardless of how turbulent a situation is, if one is willing to persevere and not lose hope, there is always a rainbow at the end,” according to a review in Nigeria’s Premium Times.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>11. Our Lady of San Juan: Four Centuries of Miracles (2021)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>This dramatization jumps in time from 1623, when a statue of the Virgin Mary miraculously saves a young girl, to 400 years later, when a desperate family takes a pilgrimage to the same site in the hopes that their child can also be saved. It stars Alejandro Peña Arenzana, Alejandra Yañez Reynoso, and Giuliana Baker.
