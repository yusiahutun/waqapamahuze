Vilifying half of them is no way to do that.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">America’s division is more than just a feeling. A study co-authored by Brown University’s Jesse Shapiro has found that political polarisation among Americans has grown rapidly in the past 40 years, and has certainly grown faster than in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and Germany.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This polarisation has teeth. While right-wing militias have been on a steady rise since the 1990s, leftists are increasingly taking up arms in response. Are we really surprised that US hate crimes are at their highest level in over a decade?</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/04/21/kim.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:30</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Asian-American families wary about school return as hate violence increases</p><p>Asian-American families wary about school return as hate violence increases</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">High-quality political leadership could soothe this tension; more political blundering and miscommunication could be a match in a tinderbox.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I’m a Republican. I believe that Conservatism has the more astute vision of the human condition; benevolent self-interest is, and always has been, the primary mechanism by which humans organise themselves into a society. I therefore naturally supported Trump, but his leadership style is both a symptom and a cause of America’s increasing polarisation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the DISC personality assessment, there are four personality types: D for Dominant, I for Inspiring, S for Supportive and C for Cautious. Trump is what we would call a High D; dominant, decisive, demanding, outgoing and task-oriented. This slipped over into a bully-boy communication style that may have seduced fellow Ds, but alienated the other personality types or temperaments.</p>Take his presidential campaigns; by resorting to name-calling (“Crooked Hillary”, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">“Sleepy Joe”</span></a>), he broke a key leadership principle; you can criticise others’ ideas, but not their character. In doing so, he sent a dangerous message to the American public: I’m a bully and it’s OK for you to be one too.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Biden must shun Trump’s tactic of using China as a bogeyman</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This behaviour created the opportunity for Biden to take the high ground. But Biden has missed this chance woefully. Referring to Trump as “sort of like Goebbels” reveals what Biden really thinks of the half of the US population who voted for Trump. A true leader can communicate with those who have different beliefs. Biden’s kind of leadership does the opposite.</p>And, of course, there’s Afghanistan. Every American watching could see that Biden was being disingenuous when he said <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">“the buck stops with me”</span></a>. He pointed fingers at the Afghan leaders who “gave up and fled the country” and the Afghan military who gave up, “sometimes without trying to fight”. To blame those you deserted is disgraceful and would not have been lost on the American public.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Weeks later, Biden also referred to the Taliban deal he inherited, which “my predecessor, the former president, signed”.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/01/13/clean_0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:41</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">UN seeks US$5 billion as winter kicks in and Afghans face ‘full-blown humanitarian catastrophe’</p><p>UN seeks US$5 billion as winter kicks in and Afghans face ‘full-blown humanitarian catastrophe’</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So which leaders might we look to, to restore the unity that America so desperately needs? I believe that, in the Republican camp, it was Ronald Reagan who created a blueprint for the kind of leadership America needs today. Asked about age at a debate, he answered: “I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet he wasn’t called the “Great Communicator” for witty one-liners. He appealed to every character type; he was the nation’s commander in times of war, and the nation’s grandad in times of peace.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He was able to speak to the dominant, inspiring, supportive and cautious temperaments within the American population; that’s precisely why he was only the second president to win an election by 49 states.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why Capitol attack marked dawn of dark days for US democracy</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">More recently, Barack Obama represented the kind of communicator that I believe we desperately need; not for his policies, but his ability to make it seem like he was talking to you. Above all, like any good leader, Obama was a listener.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This enabled him to reach across the aisle; he genuinely listened to those with a different point of view. Anybody who watched the 2020 election campaigns would know that this quality is sorely missed in American politics today.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">My message for Biden is this: take the time to understand why America is hurting in the first place. Don’t imply that Trump supporters are Nazis. Instead, empathise with why average Americans may feel dejected or left behind by the current liberal status quo. Once you have done that, communicate that message to the DISC types accordingly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unity needs to be more than a catchphrase; this country needs both a message and messenger that everyone can believe in. For the past two terms, we have had neither. The current trajectory of name-calling and finger-pointing, on both sides of the aisle, may well end up adding heat to America’s “cold” civil war.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Dave Kauffman is the founder and president of Empowering Small Business LLC, an International Business Coaching firm</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLC5zJ6lrWefpbavtc6nZpqqpJ6wrbGObGhvbGVpf3DB0malnp2UqHqius6tn56qXZy%2Fpq3TZpqopZ2qu6qvwK2mq2WYmq6tec%2Boo6KsmZiurXnDoq2inJVirq%2Bw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
