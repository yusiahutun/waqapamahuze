A friend of one of my housemates who was working as a live-in nanny-slash-cook for a wealthy family in Bethesda, brought over some leftovers from the family’s dinner and what was this? This smattering of white polka dots through a tangle of greens and vegetables? You call it couscous, too? Why has nobody told me about this before!</p><p><span id=more-269></span></p><p><a href=# title="main ingredients"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4248/35390981506_b87df23471_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="main ingredients" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="couscous, cooling"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4223/35390980066_39376a8be9_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="couscous, cooling" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="rainbow roasted tomatoes"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4238/35390980636_0df8ea87e9_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="rainbow roasted tomatoes" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="from the oven"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4219/35390979866_fc77f16bcd_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="from the oven" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Of course, back then I could barely find it anywhere, except occasionally at the Fresh Fields in upper Georgetown where they had those bins which I still miss today when I’m forced to buy half a pound of pecans when I need a half-cup. But even there, Israeli couscous was something of an enigma.</p><p>Nowadays I can find it in a lot of stores, but I feel less good about eating it. Couscous, a fact that seems to repeatedly surprise my husband (namely because he hasn’t listened the first four times I told him, I’m just saying) is not a whole grain, in fact, its closer to a pasta than anything else, formed from semolina flour. In practically any dish that you see couscous, a grain such as quinoa, bulgur or barley could be easily replaced for added nutrients and fiber, and while we often do, I just can’t be so earnest every night. I was missing my couscous.</p><p><a href=# title="blended dressing"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4220/35390979526_9da77d3b6e_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="blended dressing" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title=herby><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4209/34588410494_7b479db3ef_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt=herby data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="ready to assemble"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4248/34588410154_f77c77e931_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="ready to assemble" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="ready to mix"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4267/34588414564_512c48b43b_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="ready to mix" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>I have only three tried-and-true Israeli couscous dishes, the first, with <a href=#>roasted butternut squash and lemon</a>, and was my standby carry-along to Thanksgiving dinner all those years I was a vegetarian and <a href=#>had no issue repeating the same recipe dozens of times</a>. The second recipe is from <a href=#>Madhur Jaffrey</a>, including morels and asparagus and is a total delight.

I believe we have a new winner. Cherry or grape tomatoes are slow-roasted for an hour at a low temperature (ideal for the summer, as it will not offset your a/c’s goodness) with whole cloves of garlic. Tomatoes, when roasted, take on a deeper, more pronounced flavor, far from the artificial pungency of sun dried tomatoes, but more intense than the fresh, fruity variety. The roasted garlic is pureed with a handful of the tomatoes to make a dressing. The couscous is soaked in broth, and then minced thyme, mint and parsley are added in along with black olives. The olives amplify the flavor, without dominating, as do the array of herbs.</p><p>With a greens salad or a piece of meat or fish, dinner is most splendidly served and I get to sink <i>my</i> pearly whites into their chewy goodness, seasonally and enthusiastically, once again.</p><p><a href=# title="pearl couscous with olives and roasted tomatoes"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4260/35300786401_bbdec0f8b0_z.jpg width=640 height=427 alt="pearl couscous with olives and roasted tomatoes" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop=name>Pearl Couscous with Olives and Roasted Tomatoes</h3><ul class=jetpack-recipe-meta><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop=recipeYield><strong>Servings: </strong>Number of servings</li><li class=jetpack-recipe-time><strong>Time:</strong> <span class=time>6, heartily</span></li><li class=jetpack-recipe-source><strong>Source: </strong><a href=#>Gourmet, September 2002</a></li><li class=jetpack-recipe-print><a href=#>Print</a></li></ul><br>This recipe was refreshed with new photos (and a certain hungry toddler interruption) in June 2017.

Halve tomatoes through stem ends and arrange, cut sides up, in 1 layer on a large baking sheet. Add garlic to pan and drizzle both tomatoes and garlic lightly with oil (about 1 tablespoon). Sprinkle with salt. Roast in middle of oven until tomatoes are slightly shriveled around edges, about 1 hour. Cool in pan on a rack 20 to 30 minutes.</p><p><b>Meanwhile, make couscous:</b> Bring broth to a boil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan and stir in couscous, then simmer, uncovered, 6 minutes. Cover pan and remove from heat. Let stand 10 minutes. Spread couscous in one layer on a baking sheet or plate and cool 15 minutes.</p><p><b>When tomatoes are done, make dressing:</b> Peel garlic and puree with 1/4 cup oil, water, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 pepper, and 1/2 cup roasted tomatoes in a blender until dressing is very smooth. Adjust seasonings to taste.</p><p><b>Assemble and serve</b>: Transfer cooled couscous to a bowl and stir in olives, roasted tomatoes, herbs, and dressing. Season to taste with more salt and pepper as needed.</p><p><u>Do ahead:</u> Roasted tomatoes, dressing, and couscous can be made 1 day ahead and kept separately, covered and chilled. Bring to room temperature before proceeding.</p><br><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-269 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-269 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
