So, if you're in a dilemma over which of the two is a better option, here's a detailed guide to help you out in your search.</p><h2 id=durability-and-strength>Durability and Strength</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/person-dropping-apple-watches.jpg><p>Compared to stainless steel, the aluminum case might be more susceptible to significant, noticeable scratches as it is softer than stainless steel. However, this is not a massive issue since it's still quite difficult to shatter an aluminum case on impact. For reference, most modern cars and airplanes have aluminum bodies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While considering the appearance of minor scratches and micro-abrasions, aluminum tends to have an advantage. The aluminum case is not resistant to scratches, but it has a sleek, matte finish, ensuring that minute scrapes on the watch are not visible.</p><p>Stainless steel is much harder than aluminum, thus preventing it from cracking or shattering on impact. This makes it more durable, especially for use in sports or for use in other forms of physical activity. Nevertheless, its glossy appearance makes it more prone to minute scratches and micro-abrasions. Fortunately, the scratches are not too visible when wearing the Graphite Apple Watch, though they are quite prominent if you have the Silver color.</p><p>Fingerprints are also more prominent on the shiny stainless steel surface. However, you can solve this problem by getting one of the <a href=#>best Apple Watch cases and covers</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=weight>Weight</h2><p>On average, stainless steel is two-and-a-half times more dense than aluminum, making it the heavier of the two cases. When you compare the two options for the Apple Watch Series 8, the stainless steel is around 10 grams heavier than the aluminum version, weighing 42.3 grams, compared to 32.2 grams for 41mm aluminum watch.</p><p>If you don't like feeling the weight of your watch on your wrist, or if you have a smaller wrist in general, aluminum is the best fit for you. The lighter finish is also beneficial if you're an athlete or you exercise regularly.</p><h2 id=display>Display</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-Watch-Series-8-v2.JPG><p>The stainless steel Apple Watch comes with a sapphire crystal display. This is a tough and rigid material, giving the display good protection and high resistance to scratches. Sapphire crystal can only be penetrated with material as hard as diamond.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The aluminum Apple Watch uses Ion-X strengthened glass, which is not as strong as sapphire crystal, making it more prone to large scratches.</p><p>However, if you do decide to go with the aluminum version, you can always get a screen protector, so this might not be a big deal to some.</p><h2 id=style>Style</h2><p>The stainless steel Apple Watch is the fancier option when compared to the aluminum variant. It has a shiny, glistening surface with an aesthetic finish. If you're a conventional watch fanatic or want something visually gratifying, then the stainless steel edition is the perfect fit for you.</p><p>On the other hand, the aluminum Apple Watch is by no means less eye-catching. If you prefer matte finishes over shiny ones, you should opt for the aluminum Apple Watch instead.</p><p>There are also plenty of Apple Watch cases and wraps on the market, as well as custom bands. So you can always customize the style of your Apple Watch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=connectivity>Connectivity</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apple-watch-next-to-airpods-case-and-an-iphone.jpg><p>For the aluminum Apple Watch, you can opt for GPS-only or GPS and cellular, while the stainless steel Apple Watch only allows you to opt for GPS and cellular. The GPS and cellular models are also more expensive, which is why this is the only stainless steel option.</p><p>A GPS-only watch only allows you to receive calls and texts when connected to your iPhone via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. GPS and cellular watches allow you to access these features with or without your iPhone. The Series 8 allows streaming of Apple Music and podcasts on GPS and cellular.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To access the cellular benefits on your Apple Watch, you'll have to pay for a monthly plan. Along with that, the availability of the GPS and cellular option automatically increases the price of the stainless steel Apple Watch, even if you choose not to use cellular.</p><p>You can choose the GPS-only option for the aluminum Apple Watch and opt not to pay for a monthly plan. The price will also be lower compared to stainless steel due to the non-cellular option.</p><h2 id=price-points>Price Points</h2><p>Price points vary with each watch series, but a general trend is seen when comparing the aluminum versus stainless steel Apple Watch models. The aluminum versions are relatively cheaper than the stainless steel versions.</p><p>The lowest price for the aluminum Apple Watch is $249, but that's for the Apple Watch SE. To get an aluminum Apple Watch Series 8, you'll need to shell out $399.</p><p>The stainless steel variant, on the other hand, starts at $699.
