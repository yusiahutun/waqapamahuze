Now, at 59, she’s talking about the pressures of “looking young” and how she wishes she hadn’t given in.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1248479652-768x1023.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-courteney-cox-on-why-she-regrets-getting-filler>Courteney Cox on why she regrets getting filler</h2><p>Being in the <a href=#>celebrity</a> scene for so long, it’s natural to keep on top of your beauty treatments. However, the one this Friends star regrets most is her fillers, she told Woman’s Magazine (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via</a> Daily Mail.)</p><p>“My biggest beauty regret is fillers. There’s so much pressure to stay looking young in this industry that once you start, it becomes a bit of a domino effect and you keep on having more,” she revealed.</p><p>“To the rest of the world your face is so obviously changing, but to yourself – because you’re only having one procedure at a time – you don’t notice,” she continued before saying it was “a total waste of time.”</p><p>“It was a total waste of time and I wish I hadn’t caved into the pressure of having it,” she concluded.</p><p>It’s not the first time the actress has opened up about her treatments. Speaking earlier this year on the Gloss Angeles <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">podcast</a>, she said she’d “messed up her face” by getting too many fillers, and regrets having so much work done as a young woman.</p><p>The star had all of her filler removed in 2017 and speaking about the removal on the podcast, said: “Thank god they are removable, but I think I messed up a lot and now luckily I can, I was able to reverse most of that.”</p><p>She also revealed she “can’t believe it” when she looks back at photos of herself with them from when she “thought she looked okay.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-shares-photos-over-the-last-10-years>The star shares photos over the last 10 years</h2><p>Taking to her <a href=#>Instagram</a> a few weeks ago, the 59-year-old celebrated 10 years since <a href=#>music</a> icon, Ed Sheeran introduced her to her partner, Johnny McDaid.</p><p>The couple met through the Shape of You Singer in 2013, five years before the star got her filler removed, as she showcases the years through the montage of pictures.</p><p>Fans took to the post to comment on how adorable the love story was, as well as how great the star looked. And of course, it wouldn’t be a Courteney post if fans didn’t throw in the Friends references.</p><p>“Is he funnier than Chandler?!? Does he clean? Does he like maintaining you?” joked one.</p><p>Another laughed: “Why do I feel bad for Chandler?”</p><p>“Oh this is the cutest,” penned one fan.</p><p>“Awwww love you both so much. Happy anniversary. Xoxo,” wrote <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actress Mary McCormack.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2aEcK%2FOrqmtnZ6axm6vzrFkpp2jqLKledSpZKGdomKzoq%2FEZq6irJhitaa%2BjJugoJ%2BVqMFursSarK2xXaeyqL7ErWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
