He wrote: "Such heartbreaking news, Ollie was a warrior on the pitch and gave 100 per cent every time he represented Croydon FC.</p><p>"We spoke a couple of weeks ago about him getting back into football. I hope you find your peace, mate - sleep tight."</p><p>Croydon went on to beat Meridian FC in the London Senior Trophy at the weekend, with the victory dedicated to Spedding. Former team-mate Kieran Rufus commented: "That win and that clean sheet were for Ollie today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31492026.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_Villarreal-CF-v-Manchester-United-UEFA-Europa-League-Final.jpg><p>"He would of loved that and finishing with the song HE started at Croydon. That is all today. RIP bro, watching down on us helped us get the win for you and your family."</p><p>Spedding met partner Anderson while on set, striking up a romance with her. He opened up on his experiences on the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Anything Goes with James English podcast</a> in July of last year - expressing some regret with his career decision.</p><p>He said: "When I was at <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Crystal Palace</a>, if I'd have stayed with them, then I could have been earning a lot more playing football. I used to fight as well, maybe that could have gone somewhere.</p><p>"I was good at both of those things, but being a porn star, I thought that would be just as good. But it's not as good as people think."</p><p>Spedding made a number of concerning social media posts in the weeks leading up to his death, which included faking Anderson's death in September. He later deleted claims she'd taken an overdose and her funeral was arranged. He then posted a selfie on Instagram last month saying he'd fractured his left eye and a knee after falling through a roof.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Wopq2akaG5cK%2FRsqqtmZxivaK4wJycZqecnsOmvoysp56clJ67qHnDnpidZWNmgXp%2BlW9w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
