Maybe that's why she admitted to being not all that "surprised" when a nude photo of her was weaponized against her teen son, but that "it hadn't happened sooner."</p><p>The supermodel shared the story as part of a wide-ranging interview for <a href=#><strong>Harper's BAZAAR</strong></a> May 2024 Beauty Issue. Turlington shares two children with her husband Edward Burns: Grace, 20, and Finn, 18.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6fad6b8e-0a09-4c43-b897-b975e9ab64d9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:e81ebf6d-d722-4209-8d3d-c62ce6e611f0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=30><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/df/5by4/2023/08/11/df1bc5948245488bbaf369ad4325d054_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Rafael Pavarotti/Vogue</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'90s Supermodels Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Linda Evangelista and Christy Turlington Cover Vogue</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Turlington told the magazine that her initial instinct was, "This is so rude!" She also said, "All I wanted to do was disappear," as the incident became a much "bigger thing" when the school got involved.</p><p>Ultimately, though, she said she quickly settled down and accepted the situation as just something that happened. "I don't feel embarrassed about anything," she told Harper's BAZAAR. "Regretting things is a waste of time."</p><p>The supermodel has been fortunate throughout her career, believing that her naturally quiet disposition helped her to avoid a lot of the chaos and preying on vulnerable women that plagued the industry.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2c/4by3/2024/04/24/2c3a4eadb3804b2ca68d0b5f44cb9ed2_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Ethan James Green / BAZAAR</span><p>"Being a person who is quiet and studies people, I think I learned how to not stand out," she explained. "My mom never said, like, 'Oh, here's how you're going to protect yourself.' I think I just really paid attention, honestly."</p><p>She also expressed that at 55 years old, and four decades into her modeling career, she has no interest in that number dictating this chapter of her life. "I don't want to put myself out as the face of aging beauty," she said.</p><p>And yet, she's coming to define that concept of aging naturally and beautifully for many, based on comments seen on clips of her various public appearances, per the magazine.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0844bf8f-6918-4ed8-8e88-3dd73f36ea1e data-container-ref=toofab:article:e81ebf6d-d722-4209-8d3d-c62ce6e611f0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=30><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/94/5by4/2023/09/06/94c7de3d81a9482d99771e99e2df3e03_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Apple TV+</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Linda Evangelista and Christy Turlington Detail Life-Changing Bond in 'The Super Models' Trailer</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Christy is the most classic beauty," said her friend and fellow supermodel Cindy Crawford. "She has the type of beauty that would be described as beautiful in any century."</p><p>While her self-confidence and calm demeanor are just a part of who she is, she also credits part of that to taking the advice of her daughter when it comes to social media. "I don’t have my comments on," she shared. "My daughter told me to do that a couple years ago."</p><p>Saying she's very happy not to see them, Turlington admitted, "I can't say that I’m Teflon. I'm sure if I did read something that was pointed or mean, it would hurt me in the same way. But I also try not to give that much attention to any of it."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/94/4by3/2024/04/24/943830cf77884a688e18b3e19ced9dc5_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Ethan James Green / BAZAAR</span><p>Rather than focus on the number attached to her birthdays, Turlington is instead focusing on the passion that first drew her away from modeling regularly. After hemorrhaging in her own pregnancy, she started Every Mother Counts 14 years ago. The non-profit seeks to improve maternal health for all women, making pregnancy and birth safe for women worldwide.</p><p>To date, her organization has helped more than 1.5 million women, families, and healthcare workers, per Harper's BAZAAR. While she considers that her day job, she does not draw a paycheck, instead taking up modeling gigs "a day here and there."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:60a3672d-5f84-52b4-9423-5ac8a522b6b6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:e81ebf6d-d722-4209-8d3d-c62ce6e611f0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1e/5by4/2016/09/08/1e4a18b8ed9e5c71a44bf30be7d245b3_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Max Vadukul</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Christy Turlington Slams Plastic Surgery: I Don't Think It Looks Good</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I'll be 60 in five years, and I want to start thinking through what the next five years will be for me personally," Turlington said, emphasizing that a big part of that is the fact her daughter is getting to that age.</p><p>"Early on, I said I hope that by the time she's thinking about if and when and how and why she wants to be a mom, these [maternal health] issues are the rare event that most people think that they are. And we're very far away from that right now."</p><p>In fact, as the article argues, things are moving in the opposite direction, with America seeing a doubling of its maternal mortality rate in the past 25 years. And recent legislation related to abortion and the overturning of Roe v. Wade are setting the stage for worsening statistics.</p><p>"I am motivated most days by the momentum that’s been gained in the last 14 years," Turlington told Harper's BAZAAR. "There's more bills and legislation that maternal health is a part of ... and if things were to go the way that we don't want them to go in terms of reproductive rights, there is opportunity. And historically, I would say a lot of energy comes to the surface in those times."</p><a id=gallery-link-ed89797e-6675-4a48-b414-9bceb74356cc class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:ed89797e-6675-4a48-b414-9bceb74356cc data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:e81ebf6d-d722-4209-8d3d-c62ce6e611f0 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8c/4by3/2024/04/22/8c14ec1b1bb940d6aefb79d39e6f4306_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21ma2xfmLWztdKtsGaspae5qrrGraanZaOku260xJyipZ2UYryxvM6soKefXZ22qLSMrJqhp5%2BherWxwKZkoZ2iYru2sMRmp6GnpKR8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
