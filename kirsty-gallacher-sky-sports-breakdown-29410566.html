The couple who have two sons, married in 2010 and separated in 2015 – the year she competed on Strictly.</p><p>Speaking on the MidPoint podcast, Kirsty, 47, said: “At Sky Sports and doing Sky Sports News regularly, I was going through all the pain of what was happening, as a single mum as well as the divorce, and I was doing Strictly.</p><p><b>ALSO READ: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>GB News star Kirsty Gallacher makes jaws drop as she parades washboard abs in bikini</a></b></p><p>“I still had to sit and smile and have full-on make-up and go ‘yes, let’s talk about <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Newcastle United</a>’.</p><p>"I made some wrong decisions. My decision making, I don't need to say too much, was not brilliant and I couldn't cope with anything and I actually collapsed on Sky Sports. I didn't know what was going on and I just collapsed. I had a virus and I was also having, I think, a breakdown. I've never really been told that but I know I was because I know what was going on in my head, which was I wanted to run away, really. I was just in pain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29410733.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_JS107882509.jpg><p>"I’d been asked to do Strictly a couple of years before and I probably should have done it then. I chose the wrong time, but was sort of cajoled into it.”</p><p>Asked if she had enjoyed it, she said: “I didn’t – I was a wreck, skinny as a rake, I was running on empty.

Thankfully, it's benign and not hugely detrimental to my normal life.</p><p>"However, the tumour has caused severe tinnitus which makes it very difficult to sleep.
