However, with the album finally out (including 15 additional tracks that appear on a surprise double-album edition, called The Anthology), it’s clear many of the songs are actually about Swift’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a43875285/taylor-swift-matty-healy-relationship-timeline/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="whirlwind relationship with Matty Healy, frontman of British pop-rock band the 1975" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">whirlwind relationship with Matty Healy, frontman of British pop-rock band the 1975</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">All throughout The Tortured Poets Department, Swift seems to be revisiting her brief dalliance with Healy, and there are Easter eggs and clues to spare.

Then there’s the already-viral lyric “You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate / We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist.” In 2018, Healy <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/taylor-swifts-ex-matty-healy-once-praised-charlie-puth-in-2018/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="tweeted about his love for Puth" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">tweeted about his love for Puth</a>: “That Charlie Puth and Boyz II Men track is harrrrrd,” he posted (seemingly in reference to the song “<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJeCOo_CRyE" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="If You Leave Me Now" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">If You Leave Me Now</a>”).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Meanwhile, typewriters have been a motif throughout the promotion and rollout of the new album, and another line from the title track goes: “You left your typewriter at my apartment / Straight from the Tortured Poets Department.” Fans were quick to dig up a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tde3nYmKFlI" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="video of Healy from 2018" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">video of Healy from 2018</a>, in which he tells GQ about his love of the vintage machines. “I really like typewriters as well.

The beginning starts off with a reference to the band the Blue Nile, which Healy has <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/the1975_thteam/status/1781191122825761255 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="referenced as his favorite group of all time" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">referenced as his favorite group of all time</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The song describes Swift’s fantasies about a potential paramour, though the lyrics imply</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">she has not yet acted on her desires: “My bed sheets are ablaze / I’ve screamed his name / Buildin’ up like waves crashin’ over my grave / Without ever touchin’ his skin / How can I be guilty as sin?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the bridge, she weighs the pros and cons of giving in to her lust, despite what the public may think of her in the aftermath: “They’re gonna crucify me anyway / What if the way you hold me is actually what’s holy? / If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me / They don’t know how you've haunted me so stunningly / I choose you and me religiously.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Drownin’ in the Blue Nile<br>He sent me “Downtown Lights”<br>I hadn’t heard it in a while<br>My boredom’s bone deep<br>This cage was once just fine<br>Am I allowed to cry?<br>I dream of crackin’ locks<br>Throwin’ my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks<br>Crashin’ into him tonight, he’s a paradox<br>I’m seeing visions<br>Am I bad or mad or wise?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=58 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What if he’s written “Mine” on my upper thigh only in my mind?<br>I’m slippin’, fallin’ back into the hedge maze<br>Oh, what a way to die<br>I keep recalling things we never did<br>Messy top lip kiss, how I long for our trips<br>Without ever touchin’ his skin<br>How can I be guilty as sin?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=59 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I keep these longings locked<br>In lowеrcase inside a vault<br>Someonе told me, “There’s no such thing as bad thoughts<br>Only your actions talk”<br>These fatal fantasies<br>Giving way to labored breath takin’ all of me<br>We’ve already done it in my head, if it’s make-believe<br>Why does it feel like a vow we’ll both uphold somehow?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=60 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What if he’s written “Mine” on my upper thigh only in my mind?<br>I’m slippin’, fallin’ back into the hedge maze<br>Oh, what a way to die<br>My bed sheets are ablaze<br>I’ve screamed his name<br>Buildin’ up like waves crashin’ over my grave<br>Without ever touchin’ his skin<br>How can I be guilty as sin?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=61 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What if I roll the stone away?<br>They’re gonna crucify me anyway<br>What if the way you hold me is actually what’s holy?<br>If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me<br>They don’t know how you’ve haunted me so stunningly<br>I choose you and me religiously</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=62 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What if he’s written “Mine” on my upper thigh only in my mind?<br>I’m slippin’, fallin’ back into the hedge maze<br>Oh, what a way to die<br>I keep recalling things we never did<br>Messy top lip kiss, how I long for our trips<br>Without ever touchin’ his skin<br>How can I be guilty as sin?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=63 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He sent me “Downtown Lights”<br>I hadn’t heard it in a while<br>Am I allowed to cry?</p><h2 data-node-id title="“I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)”" data-anchor-id=i-can-fix-him-no-really-i-can class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">“I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)”</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=65 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In “I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can),” Swift takes aim at her partner’s bad-boy reputation. Tellingly, the first verse hints at Healy’s history of disturbing behavior, which her fans loudly disapproved of: “The jokes that he told across the bar / Were revolting and far too loud.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=66 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite this, Swift repeatedly tells herself that she “can fix him.” In the second verse, she sings, “I could see it from a mile away / A perfect case for my certain skill set / He had a halo of the highest gradе / He just hadn’t met me yеt.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=67 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But by the end of the track, Swift has reconsidered, admitting that “maybe I can’t.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=69 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The smoke cloud billows out his mouth<br>Like a freight train through a small town<br>The jokes that he told across the bar<br>Were revolting and far too loud</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=70 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They shake their heads sayin’, “God, help her”<br>When I tell ’em he’s my man<br>But your good Lord doesn’t need to lift a finger<br>I can fix him, no, really, I can<br>And only I can</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=71 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The dopamine races through his brain<br>On a six-lane Texas highway<br>His hands so calloused from his pistol<br>Softly traces hearts on my face<br>And I could see it from a mile away<br>A perfect case for my certain skill set<br>He had a halo of the highest gradе<br>He just hadn’t met me yеt</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=72 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They shake their heads sayin’, “God, help her”<br>When I tell ’em he’s my man<br>But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger<br>I can fix him, no, really, I can<br>And only I can</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=73 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Good boy, that’s right, come close<br>I’ll show you Heaven if you’ll be an angel, all mine<br>Trust me, I can handle me a dangerous man<br>No really, I can</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=74 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They shook their heads sayin’, “God, help her”<br>When I told ’em he’s my man (I told ’em he’s my man)<br>But your good Lord didn’t need to lift a finger<br>I can fix him, no, really, I can (No, really, I can)<br>Woah, maybe I can’t</p><h2 data-node-id title="“The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived”" data-anchor-id=the-smallest-man-who-ever-lived class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">“The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived”</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=76 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Swift contemplates a relationship after it has ended in “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,” second-guessing the strength of her partner’s bond with her. The first clue the song is about Healy comes in the first verse, in which she sings about his “Jehovah’s Witness suit,” likely a jab at the suits Healy and his 1975 bandmates often perform in. She suggests the relationship met its end after her partner ghosted her: “You tried to buy some pills / From a friend of friends of mine / They just ghosted you / Now you know what it feels like.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=77 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The chorus indicates the time period during which Swift and Healy had allegedly started dating, with the two first going public around in May 2023: “And I don’t even want you back, I just want to know / If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=79 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Was any of it true?<br>Gazing at me starry-eyed<br>In your Jehovah’s Witness suit<br>Who the fuck was that guy?<br>You tried to buy some pills<br>From a friend of friends of mine<br>They just ghosted you<br>Now you know what it feels like</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=80 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And I don’t even want you back, I just want to know<br>If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal<br>And I don’t miss what we had, but could someone give<br>A message to the smallest man who ever lived?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=81 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You hung me on your wall<br>Stabbed me with your push pins<br>In public, showed me off<br>Then sank in stoned oblivion<br>’Cause once your queen had come<br>You’d treat her likе an also-ran<br>You didn’t measure up<br>In any measurе of a man</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=82 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And I don’t even want you back, I just want to know<br>If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal<br>And I don’t miss what we had, but could someone give<br>A message to the smallest man who ever lived?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=83 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead?<br>Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?<br>Were you writin’ a book?

You know who you are. I love you.” Days later, at Swift's Nashville show during the U.S. leg of the Eras Tour, she mouthed the same phrase, an act that seemingly confirmed their rumored romance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=89 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The verse also hints at Healy's young romantic interests following his split from Swift, from his brief reconciliation with ex-girlfriend Meredith Mickelson, 24, in August 2023 to his current relationship with model <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a60539693/who-is-matty-healy-girlfriend-gabbriette-bechtel/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gabriette Bechtel" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Gabriette Bechtel</a>, 26.
