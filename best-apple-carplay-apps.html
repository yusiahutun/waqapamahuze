And to get the most out of this feature, you should have apps compatible with CarPlay installed on your iPhone.</p><p>Let's take a look at some of the best Apple CarPlay apps worth using.</p><h2 id=a-note-on-available-carplay-apps>A Note on Available Carplay Apps</h2><p>Unfortunately, only a small selection of iOS apps are compatible with CarPlay. The vast majority of them fall into one of three categories: audio, navigation, or messaging. As a result, you probably won't end up installing too many of these apps, since they overlap a lot.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>We'll cover the most useful built-in CarPlay apps so you know how to use them, then move on to some of the best third-party apps for CarPlay. If you use a different audio or navigation service than what we highlight here, chances are that it's also available for CarPlay.</p><p>In case you're wondering how to add apps to CarPlay, you don't need to do anything special. Simply install the app on your iPhone as normal, then open it once to walk through any initial setup. If the app works with the feature, you'll see it in the list of apps on your vehicle's display once you start CarPlay.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If you're new to this function, read our <a href=#>overview of Apple CarPlay</a> first so you're up to speed. And while it's not a proper CarPlay app, remember you can tap <strong>Now Playing</strong> from the app list to jump right to whatever audio source is active.</p><h2 id=the-best-built-in-apple-carplay-apps>The Best Built-In Apple CarPlay Apps</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/01-CarPlay-Home.png><p>First, let's look at the most useful apps included on your iPhone that work with CarPlay.</p><p>Note that in addition to these, Siri can also access features of the built-in Clock, Reminders, and other apps. You won't see CarPlay icons for them, but you can use commands like "Add paper towels to my grocery list" or "Set an alarm for 7am tomorrow."</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=apple-maps>1. Apple Maps</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/02-CarPlay-Apple-Maps.png><p>If you don't prefer another navigation app (see below), Apple Maps works great with CarPlay.</p><p>Upon opening it, you'll see an overview of your location. Hit the <strong>Destinations</strong> link and Maps will suggest places based on where you are or what you've discussed in messages and emails recently. You can use the <strong>Search</strong> function to quickly find gas stations, food, and more.</p><p>Use the microphone button on your steering wheel, or tap the <strong>Microphone</strong> icon on the screen, to navigate with Siri.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=phone>2. Phone</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/03-CarPlay-Phone.png><p>The Phone app's CarPlay integration lets you make and receive calls in your car. Opening the app lets you browse your contacts, open a dialer, review recent calls, or check your voicemail.</p><p>However, since scanning through a list of contacts or using a dial pad while driving is unsafe, it's better to just use Siri integration to say something like "Call Sarah Smith."</p><h3 id=messages>3. Messages</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04-CarPlay-Messages.png><p>The Messages app lets you converse safely in the car. Tap a conversation to hear its most recent messages read aloud. You can also dictate a new message using your voice here.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Try saying "Text Norah I'll be home in 15 minutes" or "Read my latest text messages" to use the app without opening it.</p><h3 id=apple-music>4. Apple Music</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/05-CarPlay-Apple-Music.png><p>It's much easier to enjoy a drive with the right music. Use the Music app with CarPlay to enjoy the entire Apple Music catalog, if you're a subscriber. Of course, you can also listen to anything you've purchased from iTunes.</p><p>Open the app to scroll through your library and playlists. It's also easy to ask Siri to play your favorite artists, albums, genres, and more.</p><h3 id=podcasts>5. Podcasts</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/06-CarPlay-Podcasts.png><p>Prefer podcasts instead of music on your commute? Use the Podcasts app to access shows you've subscribed to on your iPhone.</p><p>Siri can also help with commands like "Play the Really Useful Podcast" or "Skip ahead one minute."</p><h2 id=the-best-third-party-apple-carplay-apps>The Best Third-Party Apple CarPlay Apps</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/07-CarPlay-App-Drawer.png><p>While the above apps come pre-installed on every iPhone, several third-party apps work with CarPlay as well. There isn't a lot to choose from, but they all support Siri for hands-free control.</p><p>On the CarPlay home screen, you'll see icons for any CarPlay-compatible apps you have installed on your iPhone. In addition to the below apps, CarPlay is also equipped to work with supported car manufacturer apps for controlling your vehicle's features. This can let you access your car's climate control without leaving CarPlay, for example.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>While in CarPlay, you'll also see an app with the name of your car make. Tap this to return to the stock infotainment system.</p><h3 id=waze>6. Waze</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/08-CarPlay-Waze.png><p>Starting in iOS 12, Apple opened up third-party navigation apps for use with CarPlay. While Google Maps is also available, Waze is more distinct, which is why we include it here.</p><p>The main draw of Waze is its community-sourced information. The app alerts you to nearby speed traps, construction zones, and obstacles on the road. Give it a try if you find Apple Maps lackluster.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Waze</a> (Free)</p><h3 id=tunein-radio>7.

TuneIn Radio, one of <a href=#>the best radio apps for iPhone</a>, is available on CarPlay.</p><p>Using it, you can browse over 100,000 radio stations from across the world. For quick access, save your favorites on your phone before you start driving.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TuneIn Radio</a> (Free, subscription available)</p><h3 id=audible>8. Audible</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10-CarPlay-Audible.png><p>If you enjoy audiobooks, Amazon's Audible service is a great way to get your fix. A subscription allows you to download and keep a new book each month, and there are tons of genres to choose from. If you don't want to subscribe, you can buy books individually, though this isn't as cost-effective.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Inside the CarPlay app, you can play any downloaded audiobooks, so make sure you save them offline while on a Wi-Fi connection. Check out our <a href=#>top Audible tips</a> to get more from the service.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Audible</a> (Free, subscription available)</p><h3 id=whatsapp>9.

When you open it, you can choose to hear unread messages read aloud or dictate a new message.</p><p>All the voice commands you'd expect are here, though, so you can have Siri read your incoming messages and respond via voice. With the app installed, you'll also see WhatsApp notifications on the CarPlay home screen (unless you're in Do Not Disturb mode).</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp</a> (Free)</p><h3 id=spotify>10.

Like other music apps, Spotify's CarPlay integration lets you browse your playlists and other saved music through its interface. Alternatively, just use Siri to start playing an album or genre.</p><p>Spotify also hosts podcasts, so you can manage a lot of audio entertainment in one app. Remember that <a href=#>you'll need Spotify Premium</a> to listen ad-free, save music offline, and disable shuffle mode.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a> (Free, subscription available)</p><h3 id=mlb>11.

With CarPlay, you can listen to game audio while driving, but will need an MLB Audio subscription to do so. That subscription also unlocks other premium features, including condensed games.</p><p>Using the free version, you can still check out the game of the day, but can't listen to it with CarPlay.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MLB</a> (Free, subscription available)</p><h3 id=more-apple-carplay-apps-to-try>More Apple CarPlay Apps to Try</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, many of the other best apps for CarPlay are quite similar to the above.

There are plenty of options for listening to music or podcasts, sending messages via voice, and navigating around.</p><p>As CarPlay becomes more popular and available in more cars, we'll hopefully see additional apps make their way to the platform. In the meantime, there are lots of non-CarPlay apps that make for a more efficient driving experience, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fl7K0wIyap6mklWKwor7PpZiyZZGlvbR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
