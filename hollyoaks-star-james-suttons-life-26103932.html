I want to see if a theatre fancies giving me a job, or perhaps do a drama or film."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25682736.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/1_BANNER.jpg><p>However he added that the door is always open for Ryan to return, saying: "The producers are leaving the door open for me, which is very sweet of them. They're not killing my character.</p><p>"When Ryan starts getting into trouble with Cain and the police come to interview him he thinks, 'You know what, I need to get away. I can't be around Cain, he's a terrible influence'.</p><p>"It's Ryan's choice to leave. He packs his bags and heads off into the sunset."</p><p>Away from the soaps, James has certainly had a successful acting career too, delighting viewers with roles in TV programmes including Scott & Bailey, Dream Team 80s, Holby City and Bedlam.</p><p>He is also listed as starring as Russ in a new film called Made You Look, which is currently in pre-production.</p><h3>Bingo caller job</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Although James has had a long acting career both on screen and onstage, there was a period of time when he sadly did not secure roles from the auditions he went to.</p><p>During this time James took up a second job as a bingo caller, but he revealed to The Daily Record that it was not as fun as he thought it would be.</p><p>He said: "It was just horrible. Let's just say I'm glad that my first choice of acting worked out.</p><p>"I'd love to say bingo calling was a laugh, but it was hell. Pure hell. I only did it for two months and that was long enough."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26104545.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_EMMERDALE.jpg><p>Talking about the job, he said that he became a bingo caller to "make ends meet", but that he was glad when an acting role eventually knocked on his door.</p><p>"I was being trained to use all the lingo but it really wasn't for me," said James.</p><p>"It's the nature of the beast though, in acting. Whenever there's no work, you do what you need to do to make ends meet, it's as simple as that.</p><p>"I went for loads of auditions during that time though and I'm so glad something came up. I'd have made the worst bingo caller in the world."</p><h3>Stunning wife</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26104551.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Inside-Soap-Awards-Launch-Party.jpg><p>Away from the limelight, James has shared photos of him and his stunning wife Rachael Collin on social media.</p><p>The couple have been married since 2018, and to celebrate their big day James posted a sweet snap of the newly married couple on Instagram, with them dressed up to the nines under an umbrella.</p><p>The photograph was captioned: "Thank you to everyone who made the trip down to Glastonbury and made our day so special.</p><p>"We love you all," James continued, adding the hashtag: "#CloudyWithAChanceOfSuttons."</p><p>Before marrying Rachael Collins, the star was also engaged to model Kit Williams for two years between 2015 and 2017.</p><p>It has also been reported that he has had romantic links to other celebrities including Sammy Winward, Catherine Tyldsley and Jessica Fox.</p><h3>Health battle</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26104796.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Hollyoaks-John-Paul-and-Craig.jpg><p>James opened up to fans about his battle with his mental health in an emotional Instagram post last year.</p><p>In the video, the actor shared that he was struggling with anxiety, saying: "I have been waking up and feeling anxious all day long.</p><p>"Feeling, like, a sense of impending doom, like all of a sudden everything’s going to go to sh*t and my whole life’s gonna fall apart."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26105497.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Inside-James-Suttons-life-Emmerdale-stint-second-job-and-health-battle.jpg><p>He added that social media played a huge part in his anxiety, saying: "I realised that a lot of that is down to how I’m starting my day.</p><p>"Historically, I start my day by waking up and checking Twitter and checking Instagram. I realise the irony of me posting this on Instagram!"</p><p>However, James ended the video by sharing some updates on how he is managing struggling with anxiety, which included taking part in regular meditation sessions, and not checking social media as soon as he wakes up.</p><p>He also explained that his family and friends had been supporting him, saying "I’ve been spending a little bit of time being grateful for the things that I have: my health, and I have my family.</p><p>"If you are really struggling, then speak to someone," said James, adding: "Speak to a family member or a friend or just speak – talking is always the best thing… Be kind to each other."</p><p><b>Hollyoaks airs weekdays on Channel 4 at 6.30pm followed by first look episodes on E4 at 7pm</b></p><p><b><i>For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section>here.</a></i></b></p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25605700><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|Image aria-label="Hollyoaks Jorgie Porter's life - Racy confessions, fans' foot fetish and co-star romance" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25605700><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26104557.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_JOHN-PAUL-1.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25606933.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_BANNER-Jorgie.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25605700>Hollyoaks Jorgie Porter's life - Racy confessions, fans' foot fetish and co-star romance</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25380189><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|Image aria-label="Hollyoaks' Ashley Taylor Dawson's life – pop star past, club career and tragic pal death" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25380189><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26104563.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_British-Soap-Awards-Red-Carpet-Arrivals.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25381059.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Ashley-Taylor-Dawson.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25380189>Hollyoaks' Ashley Taylor Dawson's life – pop star past, club career and tragic pal death</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLWwuMuyppqjo2LAta3RZqGapZWoerTB062mp6tdobansYxrbWpoY26Acw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
