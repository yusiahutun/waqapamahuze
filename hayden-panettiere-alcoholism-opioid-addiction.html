"I didn't want to be around me. But with the opiates and alcohol I was doing anything to make me feel happy for a moment. Then I'd feel worse than I did before.

I'm good. It's an everyday battle, it really is. I'm grateful to say that I'm sober today," she said. "I put a lot of work into myself and I had to be willing to be incredibly honest."</p><p>Panettiere said she doesn't "regret even the ugliest things that have happened to me," adding that she still feels "incredibly accomplished" and like she's now been given "a second chance."</p><p>Speaking of second chances, she'll once again step into the shoes of Kirby Reed -- a fan favorite character from "Scream 4" -- for the upcoming sixth film.</p><p>"I called them up myself and was like, 'So, you guys don't happen to want to bring Kirby back, do you?'
