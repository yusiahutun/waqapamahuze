Though many fans are more than familiar with her character — who was married to Derek Shepherd, played by <a href=#><strong>Patrick Dempsey</strong></a> in the show — it’s time for you to know all about her real-life husband, <a href=#><strong>Chris Ivery</strong></a>!</p><p>In 2003, the pair met in a grocery store and quickly formed an undeniable connection. After four years of dating, Chris asked for Ellen’s hand in marriage and the two tied the knot in New York City in November 2007. “We were six degrees our whole lives, so I feel like we were sort of meant to be,” she once gushed to <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p>After they said, “I do,” Chris and Ellen became the <a href=#>doting parents of their three kids</a>. The SAG Award winner gave birth to their first child, Stella, in 2009, followed by their second daughter, Sienna, in 2014. The lovebirds completed their family when their son, Eli, was born in 2016.</p><p>Out of all the amazing things Chris does for his wife, Ellen said the music producer always makes her feel like she’s the most beautiful woman in the world. “He tells me constantly how I have the body of a 20-year-old. He is the best,” the Daredevil actress shared with <a href=#>People</a> in 2016, adding Chris doesn’t really like her wearing a lot of makeup. “[He] is so supportive. He is amazing.”</p><p>The acting legend and the handsome hunk have managed to make their marriage work by accepting each other for whom they are. “Just don’t try to change people,” the <a href=#>Golden Globe</a> nominee explained to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> about what makes her and her hubby so compatible. “They were fine when you married them, so don’t expect them to change.”</p><p>One thing Ellen loves about the Massachusetts native is that he has “swag” and makes her feel “secure.” The <a href=#>Station 19</a> actress couldn’t help but marvel over her “fantastic” spouse when she made an appearance on <a href=#>The Queen Latifah Show</a> in 2013. “I think that’s probably why I’m so into him,” she said at the time. “Nothing shakes him. If it did shake him, I wouldn’t know.”</p><p>As the pair continue on in their lives of wedded bliss, they can always count on each other to have their backs. After all, that’s what loving someone is all about.</p><p><strong>To learn more about Ellen’s longtime love, keep scrolling!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46eo6WdnmK9sLnPnqZmpZGnv6qxw2admpukqHpyf5VsaXFn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
