Obviously, the goal was to keep their own celebrity relationship a secret whilst sharing two truths and a lie about them.</span></p><p><span>Our star, Travis claimed his celebrity relative was his actor father with a Critics Choice Award. He even dropped the hint that this sister took carpet photos of him with famous female celebrities alongside his father. As if that wasn’t enough, during a talent show portion of the premiere, Travis recited a long stream of numbers in the mathematical Pi — which was a major clue about who his father might be. Ironically, he won that challenge and was therefore protected at the Guess-Off and given an extra clue.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Hugo and JR came in last place, and Hugo was elected the season’s first Guesser. At the Guess-Off, Hugo then chose to target Carly and correctly guessed that she is Tom Hanks’s niece. Thus, Carly bid a tearful goodbye to the rest of the contestants whilst making sure to let Hugo know that she was upset he had targeted her.</span></p><p><span>“I helped you, Hugo. F</span><span>ricken helped you. I gave you clues, and if any of them are right, I swear I hope you go home because of that,” she shouted at him before storming into the mansion screaming about how the clues had been too obvious.</span></p><p><span>Outside the show, she regretted, “I really wished I used my Aunt Rita as my celebrity relative. That would have made it so much harder to guess.”</span></p><h3><b>Who Is Travis Tyson Famous Relative?</b></h3><p><span>Travis Tyson is the son of the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. So, he wasn’t lying when he said that his sister took pictures of him on the red carpet. Also, Neil indeed was nominated for Critics’ Choice Award in 2014 for his show </span><i><span>Cosmos</span></i><span>. Guess, Travis just bent the truth a little on that part.</span></p><p><span>Now, talking about his family, Travis’ mother is a Mathematical Physicist named Alice Young. She met Neil at the </span><i><span>University of Texas</span></i><span>, Austin. However, their connection wasn’t instant. “He was a back-of-the-classroom kind of guy, and I was definitely front-row,” Alice said. But this is a talk for another day.</span></p><p><span>Born in Oct 1956, Alice Young earned her undergraduate degree in physics from </span><i><span>Rice University</span></i><span> and got her Ph.D. in mathematical physics from the</span><i><span> University of Texas</span></i><span>.

It could be that he learned from his father to keep things under wraps to avoid any allegations or scandals.</span></p><p><span>In case you don’t know, one of Neil’s classmates accused him of having drugged and raped her while they were in graduate school. But the astrophysicist said that while the two of them dated briefly, he never assaulted her.</span></p><h3><b>Travis Tyson Education</b></h3><p><span>Travis Tyson graduated from </span><i><span>Stuyvesant High School </span></i><span>in 2018 and joined </span><i><span>New York University Gallatin School of Individualized Study</span></i><span>.
