It comes after experts have been discussing whether the Duke of Sussex and can re-enter the royal fold.</strong></p><p>After <a href=#>King Charles</a>‘ cancer diagnosis shocked fans around the globe, state leaders and even <a href=#>Donald Trump sent their well-wishes</a>. <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> jetted over to the UK to see his dad following the news, later saying trough times like these can ‘unite families together’. Experts have been discussing whether the 39-year-old could jump back into the royal ring to help his father and brother with duties in the meantime, especially after <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> has been removed from the quota due to her abdominal surgery earlier this year. But now, a commentator has said this won’t be happening. Why? Likely down to Harry and <a href=#>Prince William</a>‘s relationship being ‘broken’ by trust, they claim.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-duke-didn-t-see-his-brother-when-he-visited>‘Duke didn’t see his brother when he visited’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1425512661-2.jpg><p><a href=#>Royal</a> commentator Pandora Forsyth, spoke to Sky News Australia on the recent development within The Firm.</p><p>After rumors the Invictus Games founder could return to Britain to fill in when needed, it was shut down by insiders who said <a href=#>William was ‘too angry’</a> to let his brother back in to work.</p><p>Pandora told the outlet: “We all well know Harry came over, he came to see the King, quite last-minute notice, it did sort of bring some public opinion back on his side. But whilst he was here, he had the opportunity to see his brother, and vice versa, and in times of need you’d really think the brothers would come together.</p><p>“They’re family, they should be coming together. He is by himself, not bringing <a href=#>Meghan [Markle]</a>, or the children all the while Catherine is recovering. They could have seen each other then – they didn’t.</p><p>“That says it all really, doesn’t it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-and-william-s-relationship-won-t-repair-itself>Prince Harry and William’s relationship won’t repair itself</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1233751240-3-1024x769.jpg><p>Pandora claimed the root problem was down to trust, which is stopping <a href=#>Prince Harry and William</a> from making a positive step in their relationship.</p><p>“At time of need, when the family needs support the most, they couldn’t come together as two grown adults and talk it through,” she added.</p><p>“The issue Harry is, is trust. Whatever conversations they have in each other, in these rooms, how does William know it’s not going to get back into a book, a podcast, an interview? He doesn’t know it’s not going to happen because of Harry’s track record.</p><p>“It’s the issue moving forward and if they want a full reconciliation, then how is that going to happen with someone you don’t know whether you can trust them. The whole point of relationships is that they’re built on trust, and unfortunately, the trust is completely broken down between the brothers”.</p><p>But Pandora says the bond between Harry and Charles is somewhat moving forward, despite Harry only <a href=#>spending 25 hours in the UK</a>. Sources claim he only managed to spend between 30 and 40 minutes with his father and <a href=#>Queen Consort Camilla</a> before they headed to Sandringham.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-does-trust-have-to-do-with-it>What does trust have to do with it?</h2><p>For some royal fans out of the loop, it may be easy to forget what ‘conversations’ experts are claiming could be published into the public eye.</p><p>In March 2021, Harry and Meghan sat down with <a href=#>celebrity</a> pal Oprah Winfrey in a tell-all interview. In the bombshell episode, they discussed details about an alleged private discussion between the Duke and his family. They claimed there were comments made about <a href=#>Archie</a>‘s skin color before he was born.</p><p>After the accusations were made, Oprah came out to clarify they were not made by the late <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a> or her husband Prince Philip. Neither Meghan and Harry would confirm who they were allegedly made by, either. Buckingham Palace released a rare statement in response, where they detailed “recollections may vary”, and said they’d deal with issues raised as a family – in private.</p><p>However, William, when on a royal event that next morning, told cameras The Firm were ‘very much not a racist family’, following the harmful allegations.</p><p>Then, in Harry’s memoir Spare, the Duke wrote down several private conversations in print for the world to see. One included a private chat with his brother and father after Prince Philip’s funeral, a time for mourning. He had organized a ‘family meeting’ to discuss the Oprah interview, but grew angry his family <a href=#>didn’t apologize to him over Meghan</a>.</p><p>Other instances were reported in the book, such as Prince William apparently getting physical with younger brother Harry during their relationship.</p><p>The Prince of Wales and Buckingham Palace have not responded to the claims from Harry’s memoir.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2eGcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaYp5xdrLatuMiapKxlopq5osDIqKWsoJmleqa606KpnqSpYq%2Bzu8qepWacn6y7bq7YZqurraOperSt2KxknKedorKvwMCtpqtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
