Not only do they shield natural hair from environmental elements, but they are also a form of expression for Black women looking to add (or remove) volume, length, and texture to their coif.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So whether you want to rock a lace front one day, or add some attitude with Beyoncé-esq Lemonade braids the other — protective styles can give you a fresh look sans permanent commitment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The best part is there are countless protective styles you can turn to for your natural curls. But if you're looking for some new inspo for 2023, we've got you. We turned to celebrity stylist&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Lacy&nbsp;Redway</a>, celebrity hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Ursula Stephen</a> — who has worked with A-listers like Rihanna, Zendaya, and Mary J. Blige — and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Authentic Beauty Concept</a> advocate and stylist&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>Justin&nbsp;Toves-Vincilione</a> for their predictions about what will be the most popular protective styles of 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading and bring this guide to your braider at your next appointment.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-oversized-cornrows></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Oversized Cornrows</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gone are the days where cornrows were only to set your hair up for a wig or weave. The ancestral style is now featured all over the runway and red carpets alike, and you'll continue to see this style in various forms all 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Zendaya really loves rocking large cornrows on the red carpet, she really owns that look," shares Stephen. "[They] are a great protective style that can be dressed up or down,"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Oversized cornrows are a quick and easy way to update your hair — they can last you up to two weeks and take less than an hour to remove. On top of that, they're super easier to accessorize. Gold jewelry, or even braiding in other colors, can change the entire look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For extra edgy glam, you can add metallic hoops to the cornrows," the hairstylist suggests. Take Zendaya's Lancôme Idole ad as an example.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once you've got your braids in, maintenance is easy — just be sure not to leave them in too long. "I love cocktailing the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Living Proof Curl Moisturizing Shine Oil</a> with the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Dove Amplified Textures Define 'N Moisture Styling Gel</a>," says Stephen. Simply run the mix over the top of the cornrows and tie the hair in place with a silk scarf. "This helps to refresh your braids and keeps the frizz to a minimum."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-box-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Box Braids</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Box braids are beloved style that have always be around, and will forever be here to stay. "I love styling [box braids] because they are so versatile and can be manipulated into really fun updo styles like I did on Celeste O'Connor for the Ghost Busters premiere," shares Stephen.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-boho-box-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Boho Box Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Redway especially loves boho box braids, which are more undone braids to give that effortless natural look, for fine hair to give it more volume. "They give the appearance of thicker strands when loose hair comes out of the braids," she says. She recommends styling these braids with a gel like the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>TRESemmé One Step Curl Crème Gel</a>; smooth it onto your ends to define movement and hydrate your natural hair.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-knotless-box-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Knotless Box Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Knotless box braids, which begin with your natural hair and have extensions added in later, can feel lighter and more comfortable than regular box braids since they prevent tension on hair, says Toves-Vincilione. They're a winner for those looking to add length, volume, and even color to their braided looks for the summer.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-structural-braided-updos></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Structural Braided Updos</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Go big or go home: More and more celebs have worn their braids in structural towers and geometric shapes on the red carpet —&nbsp;and Toves-Vincilione predicts that many will follow suit in 2023. "Updos are transforming this year," he says. "They now feature volume, three-dimensional shapes, and lots of added hair extensions."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-power-ponytails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Power Ponytails</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This effortless style has been updated with a few modern twists.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you are wearing your ponytail sky high a la I Dream of Jeannie with art-like edges, or down low at the nape of your neck exploding into voluminous curls, you can't go wrong with this classic hairstyle silhouette. Ponytails are a great way to protect fragile ends and a great style to go for if you are overdue for a trim.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The ponytail that Stephen created on LaLa Anthony for a trip to NYC in September 2021 is quickly becoming a popular go-to for the it girls. "It was sewn-on, which is stationary, so there is way less manipulation on the hair, allowing for healthy hair growth," Stephen says of Anthony's hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The style is easy to achieve and even a great DIY option for those of you taking a break from the salon. "All you need for this simple style is pomade, hair ties, a needle and thread," explains Stephen. "The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>TIGI Bed Head Manipulator Texture Paste</a> is my go-to product for this look."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-double-strand-twists></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Double-Strand Twists</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When you are growing out your hair, it's all about minimal manipulation, which is what makes protective hairstyles so alluring with the "set it and forget it" vibe. But don't think you necessarily have to make a trip to the hair store to grab extensions first. Naturalistas can lean into double-strand twists when they need a quick protective look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They are really versatile and create a really beautiful texture in natural hair," Stephen swoons. "The great thing about this style is the twists can be left in for a long time. And once they are removed, you can wear the strands loose with beautiful texture," explains Stephen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Opt for a curling cream like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Mielle Pomegranate and Honey Twisting Souffle</a> to help set the hair while twisting. This product nourishes your curls, as the formula contains sesame seed oil, which promotes growth and conditions dry hair.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-wigs-wigs-wigs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Wigs, Wigs, Wigs</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Wigs are a great way to protect the hair while achieving trendy styles throughout the season," shares Stephen. "Cardi B is someone who has rocked some really cool and beautiful wigs. The ability to change between extreme looks while protecting your hair is ideal."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But while wigs are a great canvas for creating nearly any style imaginable, as with any protective style, you want to ensure you are actually protecting your natural hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I always recommend treating the hair with extra nourishment to keep strands strong," Stephen suggests. Opt for products that will give additional hydration and lock the moisture into your strands. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Nexxus Sulfate-Free Curl Define Shampoo</a> combines marula oil and silk protein into its formula for strong curls that shine, then follow-up with your favorite moisturizing leave-in conditioner. A great year round option with powerful oils to penetrate your hair shaft is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Aunt Jackie's Quench Moisture Intensive Leave-In Conditioner</a>. The product contains shea butter and olive oil, which packs fatty acids and antioxidants to nourish your scalp and hair.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bantu-knots></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Bantu Knots</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bantu knots aren't solely a style that can be used to give you a voluminous bantu knot-out. Rocking the knots themselves are a great way to show off your face, and there are so many creative ways to personalize the look. You can do bantu knots with braids or even opt for triangle parts for a funky effect.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This style trends because some really cool celebs have been rocking them in different ways. I saw Rihanna rocking some really cute ones recently on Instagram," says Stephen. While the style may look complicated, at its most basic level, it's actually quite easy to achieve and great for any beginners to the natural hair scene.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"All you need is pomade! <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Bed Head Manipulator by TIGI</a> is one of my faves," reveals Stephen. To achieve the style, simply part your hair into as many sections as you want bantu knots. Apply the pomade to each section before twisting to keep the hair in place and double secure with a bobby pin, if necessary.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-natural-and-faux-locs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Natural and Faux Locs</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_82-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This style is fun and has become more versatile over time," states Stephen. But if you don't want to loc your natural hair, you can always opt for faux locs in an array of styles, like butterfly or goddess locs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_85-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your hair is already loc'd, think about adding some color in 2023. "I love how Chloe Bailey updated hers by adding some blonde to her hair," says Stephen. Just make sure you are keeping your scalp and hair moisturized with penetrative oil like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Shea Moisture 100% Extra Virgin Coconut Oil</a> — it easily absorbs into most hair types and replenishes protein loss.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_87-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is All Natural.
