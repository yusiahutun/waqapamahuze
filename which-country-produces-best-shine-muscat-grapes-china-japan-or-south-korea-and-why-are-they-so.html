But the cheaper Chinese Shine Muscat, which costs HK$50 to HK$100 a bunch, is more affordable.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a result, Chinese Shine Muscats have been edging out their competitors over the past few years.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Japan battles to protect premium US$100 a bunch grapes ‘stolen’ by China, Korea</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Euromonitor data cited by the Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corporation (aT), grape consumption in Hong Kong increased every year on average between 2017 and 2020, but dropped by 16.6 per cent in 2021. Another aT data set shows the volume of fresh grapes imported into Hong Kong fell from 240,798 tonnes in 2020 to 192,011 tonnes in 2021.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, imports of Shine Muscat grapes from South Korea and China to Hong Kong grew.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong imported 421 tonnes of fresh grapes from Korea, worth HK$49.9 million, in 2020, and 567 tonnes, worth HK$69.8 million, in 2021.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the same time, its imports of fresh grapes from China also rose, from 656 tonnes, worth HK$9.5 million, in 2020 to 896 tonnes, worth HK$13 million, in 2021.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China reportedly has no rights to sell Shine Muscat grapes to overseas countries, but is able to export to Hong Kong as the market is categorised as domestic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kim Suk-ju, managing director of aT, says the consumption of Shine Muscat grapes in Hong Kong has been “growing over the last few years”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/08/8a8d2310-6949-422e-8a2d-15a66224fdce_f6fb0358.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Industry insiders say that, even though the three countries grow the same variety, they taste different.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kenneth Lee, CEO of fresh food importer Top Weal, who buys Shine Muscat grapes from all three countries, says that Korean and Japanese ones are “similar [in taste], and sweeter than Chinese ones”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For aroma, Korean Shine Muscat grapes have the edge, he says. “For texture and crispness, Japanese premium ones are the best,” he adds, citing in particular grapes from Okayama. Korean grapes rate between premium and normal for texture, he adds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese Shine Muscat grapes have thicker skins and “less aroma, sourness and sweetness”, according to Lee.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/08/7f89197b-b502-421f-b790-272ea48dc13b_279b8803.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While China is expanding its market share with its relatively cheap Shine Muscat grapes and Japan is trying to maintain its exports through established distribution networks, Korean exporters are targeting the middle and high end of the market to attract customers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In September and October, aT joined hands with the Hyatt Regency Hong Kong hotel to introduce a Stay & Treat package which included a Korean Shine Muscat afternoon tea set and a bunch of Korean Shine Muscat grapes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The organisation has also amped up advertising of Korean Shine Muscat grapes on Hong Kong trams this year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Japanese Shine Muscat grapes were already known to many. So we thought introducing Korean Shine Muscat grapes, which are new to Hong Kong customers, could give customers unique experiences,” says Scarlett Chan, assistant manager for marketing and communications at the Hyatt Regency.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/08/4b5dd056-d9fb-4820-9b7c-d3ae054dff1d_a727a2ed.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Behind the story of the Shine Muscat war</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The rights to sell the Shine Muscat grape overseas are supposed to be fully owned by Japan. Shine Muscat was a variety developed by the Japanese National Agriculture and Food Research Organisation in 1988, and it was registered as an official variety in Japan in 2006.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, the Japanese organisation missed the deadline to register the exclusive rights to sell Shine Muscat grapes in overseas markets, and to secure protected rights to the plant variety under the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (Trips). Those rights expire six years after the domestic registration of a plant variety if the rights owner doesn’t file an application.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During this time, South Korea applied to register its Shine Muscat grape variety and was granted rights to sell the grapes in 2012 without paying royalties.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Treating gout with olive leaf tea: how it ended one man’s agonising pain</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s not the first time something like this has happened. Beni Haruka, a sweet potato variety developed in Japan, has been widely cultivated in South Korea after its developer also missed the deadline to register for the exclusive rights to sell in overseas markets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2021 Japan passed a law to restrict the overseas sale of seeds and seedlings. The law stipulates that to protect the intellectual property of a new breed, its developer can designate the countries to which it can be exported.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The government is reported to be considering telling developers of new plant varieties to limit cultivation to domestic growers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmm6uhnqB8or7TopqlnV9ofnqEl25naK%2BYnrCpecKorKesoq56sb7OnaycnaNir6a%2F02aqoaGemnquwdKcmK1ll6eusbHSZpqhoZ6Wequtz5qlZqeiYsCwwdOhZKSnopqubq3NnWSwoKlirrOxjK2fnrFdqLw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
