The couple has an age gap of 23 years but Aaron says, he is ‘secure’ in what he has with his wife.</strong></p><p>English actor Aaron first met his now wife Sam Taylor Johnson when he was only eighteen on the set of the 2009 drama&nbsp;Nowhere Boy, which happened to be Sam’s directorial debut as well. Even after a decade and a half of meeting Sam, Aaron is still smitten by his love for the Fifty Shades of Grey director.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1412757398-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-aaron-taylor-johnson-avoids-talking-about-marriage-and-age-gap-for-touching-reason>Aaron Taylor-Johnson avoids talking about marriage and age gap for touching reason</h2><p>Aaron’s marriage with Sam has often raised the eyebrows of fans who focused on the unconventional age gap of the couple but the Nocturnal Animals actor seems secure and rather protective of his relationship. Speaking of his marriage, the 33-year-old actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> in a recent interview, “But I’m not going to unlock things that are actually precious to me,” adding &nbsp;“I’ve got really nothing to hide, and I’m secure in what we have.”</p><p>Sam also gushed about how his feelings for Sam might have been instant when they met for the film Nowhere Boy but it never tainted their work dynamic. “I met Sam as actor and director. I think we’re really great at collaborating, but that’s not why I fell in love with her,” Sam said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1192011483-724x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Aaron reveals joy of his everyday life with kids</h2><p>Aaron and Sam share two kids Wylda, 13, and Romy, 11. Aaron is also the stepfather of two daughters who are Sam’s children from her past relationship with Jay Jopling. The actor shared he always wanted to be a young dad and he enjoys spending time with his kids the most.</p><p>“I enjoy the normality of things, the everyday stuff, getting my kids ready in the mornings, taking them to school and activities… That feeds my soul.”</p><p>Aaron also revealed that his early parenthood was not something extraordinary as he always wanted to do that. “[I knew] I was going to have a big family. I knew I was going to be a young father. I knew I was going to have many kids,” the actor said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A look at Sam and Aaron’s decade-old marriage</h2><p>Sam and Aaron met on the set of Nowhere Boy and sparks flew instantly. Within a year of dating, the couple announced marriage in October 2009. They tied the knot three years later and both chose to take the name Taylor Johnson.</p><p>Speaking of their meet-cute and how the relationship unfolded, Sam once said in an <a href=# rel=nofollow>interview</a>: “We were very professional through the entire film. … But everyone on set knew. And as soon as we finished, he told me he was going to marry me. We had never been on a date or even kissed!”</p><p>Aaron added to the story gushing, “And a year to the minute after we met, exactly one year to the minute, I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me.</p><p>For more Celebrity Tidbits stories, follow us on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Facebook</a>.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2aDcK3Aq6anZaSWxq270WahqKCeqLyvecCvpqKco2LBorjKoqWgZZGXvLbAjKaYq6qZlrSmecCnm2aZl5p6qK3PZp2oql2pvLavx6KloGWimq60u81o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
