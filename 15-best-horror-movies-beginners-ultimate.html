But there are also many subgenres – so where does one even start?</span></p><p type=p><span type=text>Here is a beginner’s guide to horror movies, divided into five subgenres and compiled by an ardent fan. Rather than simply ranking a long list, which would do neither you, the reader, nor the filmmakers justice, we’ve suggested three essential movies that will help you appreciate the nuances of each category.</span></p><p><h3 type=h3><strong type=strong><span type=text>Psychological</span></strong></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Psychological thrillers may just be my favourite subgenre. In these films, the fear seldom manifests in a physical form, leaving the audience with a slow burn of dread and anticipation.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=span><span type=text>The Shining</span></span><span type=text> </span><span type=text>(1980)</span></strong><span type=text> </span><span type=text>The Shining</span><span type=text> is a true classic, a popular adaptation of Stephen King’s novel. It follows Jack, as he brings his family to a secluded house to try and cure his writer’s block – and eventually goes insane. The film is responsible for some truly iconic images: Jack’s manic smile in the doorway, the twin girls standing at the end of the hallway, and “REDRUM” written on the mirror.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>The Babadook</span></strong><span type=text> </span><strong type=strong><span type=text>(2014)</span></strong><span type=text> After an eerie children’s book titled </span><span type=text>Mister Babadook</span><span type=text> appears in their house, a widowed mother and her son struggle with a dark, sinister figure that’s haunting them. The movie doesn’t rely on cheap jumpscares – it uses real, psychological horror that leaves viewers mulling manifestations of loss in our lives.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">Get Out was a rare horror success at the Oscars.</span></span><br class="Body__StyleBr-sc-1cgoct-9 ibAFpb"><span type=text></span><strong type=strong><span type=span><span type=text>Get Out</span></span><span type=text> (2017)</span></strong><span type=text> In </span><span type=text>Get Out</span><span type=text>, a black man named Chris accompanies his white girlfriend Rose to her parents’ house for the weekend. But it isn’t long before things take a dark turn. Revolving around the deeper ideas of race relations and manipulation, </span><span type=text>Get Out</span><span type=text> fills you with a sense of helplessness and dread. The subliminal messages and symbols are endless.</span></p><p><h3 type=h3><strong type=strong><span type=text>Slasher</span></strong></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Slashers are characterised by psycho killers with sharp weapons and murders – lots of murders.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>The subgenre is responsible for many horror tropes that have become clichés, but that’s why classics are classics.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">The shower scene. Simply iconic.</span></span><br class="Body__StyleBr-sc-1cgoct-9 ibAFpb"><span type=text></span><strong type=strong><span type=text>Psycho</span></strong><span type=text> </span><strong type=strong><span type=text>(1960)</span></strong><span type=text> Probably Hitchcock’s most popular film, a must-watch for any horror fan, and source of </span><span type=text>that</span><span type=text> shower-murder scene. A young woman goes on the run after stealing some money, pulling into a motel and meeting the owner. She goes missing, leaving her sister and boyfriend to solve her disappearance. The plot-twist ending never gets old – you’ll be keeping your lights on at night after this one.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Friday the 13th</span></strong><span type=text> </span><strong type=strong><span type=text>(1980)</span></strong><span type=text> </span><span type=text>Friday the 13th</span><span type=text> is a classic slasher movie. It’s the tale of a summer camp gone wrong: a group of teen counsellors are in charge of a summer camp, only to be stalked and murdered by a masked figure. Though there are way too many sequels (12, to be exact), the first in the franchise is definitely worth watching.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>A Nightmare on Elm Street</span></strong><span type=text> </span><strong type=strong><span type=text>(1984)</span></strong><span type=text> This is where the iconic Freddy Krueger villain was born. Another multi-film franchise, </span><span type=text>A Nightmare on Elm Street</span><span type=text> follows a group of teenagers who are stalked and hunted by the razor-clawed Krueger in their dreams – if they die there, they die in reality as well. Are you sure you want to go to sleep?</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><a data-entity-bundle=article data-entity-type=node data-entity-uuid=763c5088-bc0d-11ea-b64b-070a892763db href=# class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><span type=text>9 things to know if you’re a </span><span type=text>Hamilton</span><span type=text> newbie</span></a></strong></p><p><h3 type=h3><strong type=strong><span type=text>Supernatural</span></strong></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Movies using paranormal or mystical horror fill the audience with a sense of helplessness – possessed dolls, demons and haunted houses are completely out of our control. Though there are many fantastic modern examples of this style, if you’re new to horror, start with the classics.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=span><span type=text>The Exorcist</span></span></strong><span type=text> </span><strong type=strong><span type=text>(1973)</span></strong><span type=text> Some call this the greatest horror movie of all generations. After a girl is possessed by a demon, her mother seeks help from a priest who begins questioning his faith. Fun fact: there are theories that the film itself is cursed, so watch it at your own risk.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=span><span type=text>The Ring</span></span></strong><span type=text> </span><strong type=strong><span type=text>(1998)</span></strong><span type=text> The original Japanese film is possibly one of the scariest movies I have ever watched. If you’ve ever seen the image of a girl with long, black hair obscuring her face and a white dress, then you’ve caught a glimpse of </span><span type=text>The Ring</span><span type=text>. A cursed videotape, an investigative journalist and a killer ghost – what could go wrong?</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">Scary. Very, very scary stuff.</span></span><br class="Body__StyleBr-sc-1cgoct-9 ibAFpb"><span type=text></span><span type=span><strong type=strong><span type=text>The Conjuring</span></strong></span><span type=text> </span><strong type=strong><span type=text>(2013)</span></strong><span type=text> If you haven’t seen </span><span type=text>The Conjuring</span><span type=text> franchise, then you don’t know horror. Based on a true story, the film follows two paranormal investigators as they look into an entity terrorising a family. The suspense and horror is rich. Related movies include </span><span type=text>The Conjuring 2</span><span type=text>, </span><span type=text>Annabelle</span><span type=text>, </span><span type=text>Annabelle Creation</span><span type=text> and </span><span type=text>T</span><span type=text> </span><span type=text>he Nun</span><span type=text>.</span></p><p><h3 type=h3><strong type=strong><span type=text>Modern</span></strong></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Ari Aster and Jordan Peele are two of my favourite directors; they bring refreshing new perspectives to the horror genre, creating subgenres of their own.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Hereditary</span></strong><span type=text> (2018) Both supernatural and psychological, </span><span type=text>Hereditary</span><span type=text> is unnerving and unsettling. After the grandmother of the Graham family dies, the mother and children begin uncovering the terrifying legacy they have been left with. There are underlying metaphors for madness and guilt, and an incredible depth to each character – something that Aster is particularly brilliant at bring out. Be warned: his movies are quite graphic.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">Jordan Peele has developed his own brand of horror.</span></span><br class="Body__StyleBr-sc-1cgoct-9 ibAFpb"><span type=text></span><strong type=strong><span type=span><span type=text>Us</span></span><span type=text> </span><span type=text>(2019)</span></strong><span type=text> Peele’s </span><span type=text>Us</span><span type=text> is one of my all-time favourites. While on holiday, the Wilson family is attacked by people wearing red jumpsuits that look exactly like them – then, they realise that this is happening to everyone. Just like </span><span type=text>Get Out</span><span type=text>, the film is filled to the brim with symbolism and deep social messages that you’ll have to watch numerous times to catch.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Midsommar</span></strong><span type=text> </span><strong type=strong><span type=text>(2019)</span></strong><span type=text> Aster’s best known, and probably most popular movie. A couple travels to a beautiful Swedish midsummer festival, only to find that it is a violent and terrifying pagan cult. Terrifying and brilliant.</span></p><p><h3 type=h3><span type=text>Found footage</span></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>These films often take on the form of a documentary filmed by the main characters. It makes the movies all the more personal and thrilling, as everything the audience sees is through the character’s eyes.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=span><span type=text>Blair Witch Project</span></span></strong><span type=text> </span><strong type=strong><span type=text>(1999)</span></strong><span type=text>The Blair Witch Project</span><span type=text> essentially created the found footage genre. Three college students get lost in the woods of Maryland while making a documentary on the Blair Witch legend. They walk in circles, are haunted by strange sounds, and disturbing stick figures are found hanging in front of their tents when they wake up. What makes it all the scarier is that the “witch” is never seen. It was good enough that, for a period of time, people thought the film was real.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><a data-entity-bundle=article data-entity-type=node data-entity-uuid=af16f5df-62ff-4ae7-be42-a8b0a4874782 href=# class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><span type=text>Netflix movie gems you might have missed, from Studio Ghibli to touching documentaries</span></a></strong></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=span><span type=text>Paranormal Activity</span></span><span type=text> </span><span type=text>(2007)</span></strong><span type=text>&nbsp;A young couple, Micah and Katie, move into their apartment, only to begin suspecting paranormal activity.

The virus drives the inhabitants to madness, chaos, and murder. The found footage film feels all too real as the reporters document the murders while struggling to stay alive.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxrF7w6KqnKemmr9wsc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWamp6aesrR7wKuropucmnx0fJhsbW9uX2aCbq7ErKtmoJ%2Bnv7C%2BjKamr6GVqHqjscaipaedoqh6trjToqSarJU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
