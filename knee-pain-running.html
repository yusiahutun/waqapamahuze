I’m a regular gym-goer who dabbles in group <a href=# id=auto-tag_fitness data-tag=fitness>fitness</a>, <a href=#>Pilates</a>, yoga, and—my favorite—<a href=# id=auto-tag_running data-tag=running>running</a> outside, which I find torches more calories and leaves me more invigorated than&nbsp;anything else.&nbsp;Lately though, even a five-mile run&nbsp;is plagued by shooting pain through my knees and a dull ache for days after.</p><p>Since my early days as an amateur runner, my mom warned me to be careful, not&nbsp;to push it. She worked as an aerobics instructor throughout the late ’80s and early ’90s&nbsp;and has always been an active person, a virtue by&nbsp;which, as a current fiftysomething, she’s paid for with&nbsp;intense knee pain. My grandmother was also plagued with knee problems, having had later-in-life surgery, so it’s always been a given that mine will eventually cause&nbsp;me some grief (or double knee reconstruction, knock on wood.)</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/exercise.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Spibelt-running-pocket-belt.png><p>I’m now several days shy of 26 and have been told by just about every personal trainer I’ve ever worked with (six and counting), an&nbsp;<a href=#>herbalist</a>, and my mom (again) that I really, really should&nbsp;stop running, and I’ve finally decided to quit. Because aside&nbsp;from my family’s genetic propensity for&nbsp;dodgy knees, the facts are that&nbsp;up to <a href=# rel=nofollow>70&nbsp;percent&nbsp;of runners</a> sustain an overuse injury each year, <a href=# rel=nofollow>50 percent</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;which occur in the knee. So statistically speaking, running regularly is probably going to cause you a problem in the middle of your leg at some point.</p><p><span class=s1><strong>Yusuf Jeffers&nbsp;</strong>is a specialist running coach and trains clients&nbsp;at <a href=# rel=nofollow>Tone House</a>&nbsp;in New York, and he explained that it’s the repetitive&nbsp;nature of running that&nbsp;can cause you to</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;overuse the joint and exacerbate knee pain, either resulting in long-term damage or short-term issue. “The type of knee pain depends on the source—it could be temporary like tight muscles or tendon strain, in which case you can treat, or it could be knee pain due to cartilage damage—meniscus—that needs a permanent fix,” he said, making me feel particularly uneasy about my ongoing discomfort.</span></p><p>Jeffers&nbsp;added that while, yes, running is a great way to burn calories, it’s probably not worth pushing through any joint&nbsp;pain in your 20s if you want to avoid damage&nbsp;when you’re older:&nbsp;“<span class=s1>Each person is different and each injury is different, but ultimately you can run the risk of knee pain later in life you don’t take preventative measure.” He also recommended I avoid a bunch of exercises at the gym, including b</span><span class=s1>ox jumps, heavy squats, stairs, or any type of movement that is causing pain. “Any localized sharp&nbsp;pain&nbsp;is a signal you have an injury versus a dull pain that could just be fatigue,” he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The most common recommendation&nbsp;I receive from experts is to swap running for power walking—which to someone who loves the adrenalin rush of a&nbsp;good cardio push, sounds like the worst idea ever. Knowing this, Jeffers suggested I use the elliptical machine, row, or swim to try and re-create that runner’s high without damaging my body. “<span class=s1>Stretching before and after is really important too,” he added.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/why-quit-rowing.jpg><p>Of those options, swimming is out of the question with my current gym membership, and I personally don’t find&nbsp;the elliptical delivers the same rush as a hard run, so over the past couple of weeks I settled on rowing in the evenings and even the <a href=#>occasional rowing class</a>, which I’m surprised to say I haven’t been hating. (Jeffers promised it’s a comparable cardiovascular <a href=# id=auto-tag_exercise data-tag=exercise>exercise</a> to running,&nbsp;and that I shouldn’t expect to see a dip in my fitness levels.)</p><p>To switch out your own running habit for low-impact rowing, try and cover&nbsp;one-and-a-half times your usual distance to burn the same amount of calories—that’s what Jeffers recommended and what I’ve been doing. “If you’re accustomed to a steady-state run for 30 minutes at a moderate pace, then a similarly moderate rowing pace will put you anywhere between one to&nbsp;1.5 times the distance you’d cover when running.” Yes,&nbsp;you can literally get the same benefits, in the same amount of time, without the risk of injury.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZK%2BmrdStsGhtZGmEc36OpKWenV2lrqq6jKusp6aZo7Rw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
