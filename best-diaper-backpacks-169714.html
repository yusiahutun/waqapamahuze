This bag’s size is great. Easy to access food in the outer pouches. Changing pad right on top in a designated pocket. Zippers (for the main pouch) go all the way down. That means you can stack stuff (clothes, extra diapers, burp cloths, food, toys, books, etc.) and have access without having to dig around. I didn’t think it would make that big a difference to me (I am used to rooting around in my pack for junk), but it did. The bag stays soooo much cleaner, and I haven’t once feared [getting sticky] when diving into the bag.”</p><a class=block-product__cta href=#>buy now<span class=block-product__cta-icon></span></a><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">5.

Sometimes I get overwhelmed by pockets, however this bag has enabled me to stay somewhat organized. I was gifted a fancy diaper bag with my first child and it is a black hole. Not to mention I really like the backpack instead of the over-the-shoulder bag for ease of use! I also really like the bottle compartment, because my bottles were spilling all over my other bag. There are multiple bottle compartments, which is fantastic especially for pumping mamas! My husband appreciates using it as well because it is gender-neutral.”</p><a class=block-product__cta href=#>buy now<span class=block-product__cta-icon></span></a><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">6.

Let me tell you – you need to be organized and you need your hands free. I have had it on my back with my baby on my front whilst guiding a three-year-old through an airport, in and out of taxis. Very strong and comfortable. You can find everything quickly because of all the zipped pockets. I used the secret pocket (which is against your back when your wearing it) to hide my phone / passports which was extremely handy. The bag attaches to the stroller handle which I used every day. The wipes come out of the side pocket, which I have used for many little emergencies. I have been to the zoo, the museum, parks, shops — you name it. And walked through heavy RAIN. Everything stayed dry. Love the changing mat too!”</p><a class=block-product__cta href=#>buy now<span class=block-product__cta-icon></span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfnK6tuMSrsGiekaK2rcWOm5ysrF2ZtqK8xKtkm5mToL2ir8qsZGpuaWx%2BdQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
