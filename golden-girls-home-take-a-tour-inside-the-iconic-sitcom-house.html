Viewers finally got a look inside the beloved house when it went up for sale in mid-July. Although the Los Angeles residence was on the market for the first time ever, it’s officially no longer available after it sold for $1 million over the asking price!</p><p>The gorgeous 2,901-square-foot home was listed with Douglas Elliman real estate for a whopping $2,999,000. However, the property — which features four bedrooms, four bathrooms, a massive kitchen and stunning outdoor space — was purchased for $4,000,620 in August, <a href=#>People</a> reported.</p><p>When the home first went up for sale earlier this summer, fans couldn’t have been more excited to get a look inside. Considering <a href=#><strong>Betty White</strong></a> and her late costars, <a href=#>Bea Arthur</a>, <a href=#>Rue McClanahan</a> and <a href=#>Estelle Getty</a>, filmed on a set at a different location, the residence — which is located in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles — served as just the exterior.</p><p>The home’s appearance fits perfectly with the show’s Miami storyline, but the inside paints a whole different picture. According to <a href=#>House Beautiful</a>, the home was custom-built in 1955 by a Hawaiian architect after the owners were inspired to incorporate their family history from Honolulu.</p><p>Although it’s been nearly three decades since The Golden Girls went off the air in 1992, the legendary sitcom remains just as popular today. The show, which told the story of four older women living together in Miami while experiencing the ups and downs of their golden years, was just as memorable for the cast as it was for fans.</p><p>“We adored each other,” Betty <a href=#>once shared</a>. “It was such a special experience. Between scenes, instead of going to our dressing rooms, we’d sit there and yak about very intimate things.”</p><p>The award-winning actress even dished why her role on The Golden Girls will always be so special. “It was just heaven. It was like being with your family every day,” she has said. “I’ve missed Golden Girls since we went off the air.”</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see inside the iconic sitcom home!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46gpqWclaN6qLXRpapmoJ%2Bism7AwKScZpldqby2voyipayhlJp6tbTEZqCcp56esG6%2FyK2aqKVdnby2v8Ro</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
