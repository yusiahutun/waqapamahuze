All SDSU review committees have supported this proposal – some even said they want to take the class.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/06/d2921cc5-aeca-401d-83e7-a395d55c7632_c02518c9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Oh, the school’s approach to K-pop dance will help make it last through history. “Dance and music can fade away if they are not properly documented,” she says. The professor believes they can be made to last by converting them into educational programmes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Although there have been many popular forms of dance in history, not all have been offered as a general education subject,” she adds. “[This] move at SDSU suggests that the school has acknowledged K-pop dance is a subject [that can help] enhance students’ understanding of the humanities and arts.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">More Malaysians learning Korean as K-wave continues to take world by storm</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In contrast to other K-pop courses, usually classified as ethnic or area studies, K-pop dance will be offered as an official dance curriculum at SDSU. The professor also plans to teach a K-pop dance course for California State University’s (CSU) Summer Arts programme.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Social media offers a backstage for socialising and a front stage for performing. It has affected many factors including distribution, sponsorship, spectatorship and choreography. This new [smartphone era] accepts and expects different types of dances, audiences and sponsors, many of which were not possible for the concerts of the past.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/06/4aa64625-5c8b-4ec3-8df5-cf2debf4cf3a_f7800b8f.jpg>Oh believes that K-pop dance shares common ground with modern dance, in the sense that both embrace an experimental spirit. This can be seen in the performances of K-pop juggernaut BTS and rookie girl group <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">NewJeans</span></a>, she says.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“K-pop dance has embraced multiple stages of evolution and experimentation,” the professor explains. “An example I examined in my book was BTS, which has blurred the boundaries across modern dance, traditional Korean folk dance and shamanism.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“More recent examples include NewJeans’ 2022 releases “Attention” and “Hype Boy”. Their performances [feature] vintage, indie music and fashion, and a fresh approach to idol dance, with their airy hair, youthful bodies and effortless, cheerful movements.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The shape, lightness and forms their hair creates [when they dance] is like that of modern dance, where choreographers consider hair a part of the body movement,” she says. “This is a good tool for highlighting fragile, delicate femininity.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The professor’s dive into K-pop dance seems somewhat inevitable if we take a look at her past.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Oh studied ballet at Sunhwa Arts High School – an elite ballet school – in Seoul and majored in modern dance at Ewha Womans University. During her dancing career, she performed in various countries such as Austria, Germany, the US and Japan and won multiple dance competitions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My biggest lesson as a professional was that all forms are connected,” she says. “Dancers take various styles of classes to get inspired and to expand their movement vocabulary. It is vital to approach dance as a fluid and constantly evolving art form.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/06/bd1da4d4-4cdb-447d-9172-a811d5c38b6e_389ed22f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My professional dance background [naturally] led me to K-pop dance. Although many think it is not yet a dance genre, it is one whenever people dance to it. Consider hip-hop’s roots in underground dance clubs and the streets: today, it has changed the face of popular Western dance and dance education in the US.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Oh says K-pop dance and music are already a part of the Western mainstream in terms of popularity, visibility and sales. She believes Korean content can be further promoted and made to last by taking steps such as supporting K-pop dancers after they retire from the industry, as they will only “be in their 20s or 30s”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Korea can also support improving educational and creative environments for the younger generation [of K-pop dancers],” she says, adding that, while existing teaching models should be followed, creativity should be encouraged.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Sponsoring universities abroad to establish K-pop dance-related programmes would have a longer-lasting impact. I have around 250 students each semester – imagine how many students could learn about K-pop dance in the next 20 years until I retire.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLhuvM6pZpqqpJ6wrbGObGlqamVohXC3jKmmqWWUlruksYycpq6qo5p6trrIr5yrq5mpxm680aidnqujpL9uv8CyqmaapKh6r7HWo5yapqNirq%2BwjKiroZ2iYrSqvstmmKecXZe8unnBmqWdq12Zrq%2BvxGakqK6VqA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
