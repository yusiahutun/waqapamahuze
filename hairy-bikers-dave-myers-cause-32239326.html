At the time, Dave had said he would be "fine" following his treatment, and even joked that he would likely be "a baldy biker for a while".</p><p>Although he went public with his diagnosis, Dave didn't go into too much detail. It is not known what type of cancer he had.</p><p>While he went under the first few rounds of chemotherapy, his spirits were high, as time went on he became frail and weak. "It's funny when you first start chemotherapy, it's quite hard - I'm still having it, it was really brutal," he explained on an episode of the Seasoned podcast in March 2023.</p><p>He added that he had "lost so much weight" as a result of the treatment, and that it was a "battle" to get calories to keep the body weight up. But, ever the optimist, he said at the time that he was happy with where his treatment was at and that he wanted to "maintain" the stable weight he was at.</p><h3>Affecting his life</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32177810.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_MAIN_Hairy-Bikers-Si-King-says-its-good-to-be-alive-in-cancer-and-anorexia-battle.jpg><p>As well as his ability to eat, Dave also revealed in another podcast that the chemo had "aged" him at breakneck speed. He added that the treatment had affected his ability to walk, which he struggled with.</p><p>"Your balance goes, so for someone with a motorbike that's a disaster," he confessed on the How to Be 60 podcast. "And my walking has been affected quite a lot really - to the point that I had to learn to walk again properly."</p><p>But despite the issues he faced with his health during this tough time, he was able to get back to work in time in a welcome health update that he posted in May 2023. Myers was forced to adopt a completely different diet of fermented food to get back to fighting fitness.</p><p>Speaking on being back in front of the camera at the time, he said: "It's unbelievable to be back. Every breath I take now is just refreshing and fabulous."</p><h3>Secret health battle</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>But as time went on, Dave's battle with food and nutrition continued to be a persistent problem for the chef. In one of the last updates he gave on his health before he passed, Dave revealed that doctors had diagnosed him with anorexia.</p><p>Chatting to best pal and co-star Simon King in their latest series on the <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>BBC</a>, The Hairy Bikers Go West, he explained that medics gave him the prognosis after he struggled to put any weight on during his treatment. "At one point I was diagnosed as anorexic - can you believe it after all the dieting we've done?" he joked with King.</p><p>"But yeah, I'm doing alright now, I'm living with it," he continued. "My weight's stable, so whatever I'm doing, I'll carry on with it."</p><p>In a fitting update posted to the Hairy Bikers' joint Twitter account, Si paid tribute to his co-star and good friend, saying that he "will miss him every day". He also described Myers as "a beacon in this world", before sending him off: "See you on the other side, love ya."</p><p><b><i>For more of the latest showbiz and TV news from the Daily Star, make sure you sign up for one of our newsletters <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>here</a>.</i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdlon5qhoq56o7XKnqmsZZSWw6Z5zLKcq6tdmK62v8RmamtqY26Ac4I%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
