He also thinks Prince Harry has regrets over their living arrangements.</strong></p><p>After it was reported <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and her husband had apparently been in disagreement about whether they have somewhere permanent to stay whilst visiting the UK, Dampier believes the former actress has “complete control” in their relationship. The royal author spills on what the latest scoop is with the Sussexes.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-might-have-regrets>“Prince Harry might have regrets”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1210616995-1024x742.jpg><p>Talking on GB News, the author spoke of<a href=#> Prince Harry’s</a> life before he met Meghan, such as his career in the military. Dampier was <a href=# rel=nofollow>discussing</a> rumors over the pair buying up <a href=#>real estate</a> in Britain. At the moment, they have no ties to Harry’s homeland after they gave up Frogmore Cottage.</p><p>He said: “I can sometimes imagine he might have regrets, but I think that she very much rules the roost. I think she wants to remain in California.”</p><p>Dampier then said he believed Harry “will do what she tells him, to be honest.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Meghan Markle grew up ‘watching videos of the royal family’ – ‘she was fascinated’</a></p><p>It had been previously claimed King Charles was looking at giving the <a href=#>royal</a> couple and their two children a place of their own whenever they came to the UK. However, Kensington Palace has denied the claims.</p><p>In a statement in which they bluntly said: “These claims are not true.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-could-meghan-move-on>Could Meghan move on?</h2><p>In the discussion, the experts also talked about the possibility that “surely there would be men queuing up to look after” the Duchess of Sussex, <a href=#>who “admired” Harry</a> in her teen years. But this was just in jest after the claims their marriage was on the rocks. Rumors that neither of the royals have dignified with a response. The pair is clearly still a force to be reckoned with and a strong unit, after recently appearing at the Invictus Games and an event in New York last week.</p><p>“I’m sure she could find somebody,” Dampier joked, before saying: “In terms of moving back to the UK, I think what we might see is more of Harry coming back on his own. I mean, they’ve not got a home over here anymore.”</p><p>He believes it will be the prince’s work that will bring him back to where he was born. Causes close to his heart, such as the Invictus Games, rather than family affairs. But Dampier doesn’t think the <a href=#>former actress</a> will ever follow.</p><p>The author added: “I think he’s got an excuse to come back [and] I think he might well come back on his own, but I don’t think she wants to come back to this country at all.”</p><p>He then said the idea “wouldn’t surprise” him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-keeping-up-with-harry-and-meghan>Keeping Up With… Harry and Meghan?</h2><p>A source told Bella Magazine momager <a href=#>Kris Jenner wanted the pair to appear </a>on their Hulu series The Kardashians.</p><p>The insider claimed: “It’s no coincidence that the Kardashians all move in the same circles as Meghan’s new circle. It’s just a slam dunk for the two families to team up, but Kris doesn’t want to push too aggressively, too soon.”</p><p>The 67-year-old has “assured” their team that there is “no issue in principle” in them even just making a cameo.</p><p>The source also said: “Even if it’s just a cameo, that’s a huge win for Kris, the business side is now in motion and looking very lucrative.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>‘Embarrassed’ Prince Harry and Meghan ‘fighting to tell their side of the story’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2eBcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GagrGWUmq6ttc2gZLChpJ16s7HGq5ytq12XwrV5zJ6eoZmeYr%2BmucCipaxlmaN6pLvMqaOerJVisLC606umpWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
