The mother-of-two later admitted publicly that she would leave the office early to be able to see her children in the evening, which inspired other mothers to be open about doing the same.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her viral TED Talk and Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead book pushed for women to have “a seat at the table” in male-dominated companies and from this grew her online community of “ambitious women creating a more equal and inclusive world”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who is the richest woman in the world right now?

She wed Brian Kraff in 1993 but they split the following year, and she married Dave Goldberg in 2004. But he suddenly passed away when they were on holiday in 2015. She admitted on The Ellen Show that it made her realise she was “resilient” and that she also lost confidence when he died.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/08/cdd976b0-01e0-4444-bb75-ce9ed2785a4e_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Father’s Day will always be bittersweet for me and my children.

He’s embraced my children as his own and allowed me to embrace his as my own.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">She’s worth US$1.5 billion</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/08/b267aecb-d362-42fe-84f4-690e64dc2c0c_71634145.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sandberg sold US$1.8 billion worth of shares in Facebook to date, pre-tax, according to FactSet. Forbes calculated that by June she had parted ways with 92 per cent of the 17.9 million shares she had in March 2013. The publication reported that she had been “aggressively” getting rid of her stake in the company since it went public in 2012.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Inside Dream Kardashian’s fabulous life, from baby Bentleys to Amazon ads</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/08/309fc561-34ba-4fd5-a891-8cbdf2948b01_27eebff3.jpg>Meta saw shares reach an all-time high in late 2021 and Sandberg still owns 1.5 million shares worth US$290 million. Her current base salary is believed to be over US$900,000. Much of her wealth reportedly comes from offloading her shares in the company.

Sandberg hasn’t revealed exactly what she will do professionally when she steps down later this year, but she will focus on her philanthropy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/08/1c44741a-5d29-4a1d-80a5-d147272dfcaf_13f209af.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I am not entirely sure what the future will bring – I have learned no one ever is. But I know it will include focusing more on my foundation and philanthropic work, which is more important to me than ever given how critical this moment is for women,” Sandberg posted on Facebook. “And as Tom and I get married this summer, parenting our expanded family of five children.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After Facebook went public 10 years ago, Sandberg started two charities, but in recent years the press has questioned where her US$320 million in philanthropic giving has gone. Only US$12 million can be verified to have gone to her Lean In and Option B charities.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Move over, Scott Disick!
