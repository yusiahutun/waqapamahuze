Its use has been quite well documented, and she is often called the sweet pet name in the <a href=#>Netflix</a> series The Crown.</p><p>It was given to the <a href=#>Queen</a>, who died in September 2022 at the age of 96, by her dad King George V. This was because as a young girl, she could not pronounce her name and would say something that sounded similar. The nickname stuck, and the royals called it her into adulthood.</p><p>She even used it to refer to herself. It is known she used it to sign off a letter to her grandmother, Queen Mary.</p><p>She penned: “Darling Granny. Thank you very much for the lovely doll’s house. I do love it, and I have unpacked the dining room and the hall. Love from Lilibet.”</p><p>However, Lilibet is actually a name in its own right and not just a cute name given to <a href=#>King Charles’</a> mom. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to</a> TheBump, the name means “God’s Promise” or “God Is My Oath.”</p><p><strong>Celebrity Tidbit and GRV Media have contacted Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s representatives for comment.</strong></p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Prince Harry and Meghan ‘have nothing left’ and are ‘scrambling for new deals’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aDcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaYp5xdorKotMCnZJyZnKG2r7OMnZiun5ipsrN50K6cnqajYruqr8qnmKadXaGyp8CMoZyrZZGjtLPFjJqsraCfp3q0rdisZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
