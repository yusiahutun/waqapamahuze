It’s the ultimate ‘girl’s night out’ brand. (Case in point? No less than Nadine Merabi outfits were worn on the first episode of the latest season of .) “It all goes back to empowerment and feeling like your best, most confident self when you wear the pieces,” she says. &nbsp;</p><p id=eUwmfmDTgzn data-wc=112>Merabi’s passion for explosive palettes and celebration of timeless glamour stems from her Middle Eastern parentage, combined with timeless shapes and fine quality tailoring. “I think the embellishments and intricate detailing add that wow factor to every piece which sets them apart,” she explains, “I think I'm subconsciously drawn to these elements because of my Lebanese heritage. Fashion there is full of bold colours, embellishments, and expert craftsmanship which I incorporate into my own designs. Renowned for making her signature party-wear, she is now venturing into <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>her first ever resort collection</a>. “The idea behind the Resort collection was to provide the ‘Merabi Muse’ something to wear outside of occasions,” she tells us.&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eyMjevuvve1 data-wc=17><strong>We caught up with the eponymous designer to find out more about her first ever resort collection:</strong></p><h3 dir=ltr>What inspired you to create a resort collection, and what sets it apart from your previous designs?</h3><p id=erToB-GB_vR data-wc=46>I got to be more experimental with this resort collection which was really fun. I played with new silhouettes, fabrics, and materials which inspired me to think outside the box. I think the colours, cuts, and patterns are what really set it apart from previous collections.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6d739038aa9e-18e1440f4e-4c59-4dfb-bc88-3d6b2f6d6466800x.jpg><h3 dir=ltr>Can you describe the overall concept behind your new resort collection?</h3><p id=eZNtgdvnrS- data-wc=57>I wanted the ‘Merabi muse’ to have something special to wear on holidays. The original idea was that I needed things to travel with that could be taken day to night quite easily and wouldn’t wrinkle terribly in my case. Many of the pieces are a bit more toned down to match the relaxing vibe of holidays.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir=ltr>What fabrics and materials did you incorporate into this collection to create a luxurious and comfortable holiday experience?</h3><p id=eXOECd-lMHB data-wc=46>I incorporated 3D embellishments, sequin embroidered mesh lace, sequins and other fun materials into this collection to bring a new dimension of Merabi glam. We also use a lot of high quality satin materials for a large portion of the collection to add versatility and comfort.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/68156c71b8f2-ecompdpcrops3800x.jpg><h3 dir=ltr>Resort wear often focuses on functionality and versatility. How did you address these aspects in your designs while maintaining your signature aesthetic?</h3><p id=ephzkm0iohy data-wc=41>I think this collection can be worn day to night quite easily. The fabrics are lighter and everything is easily packable for your holidays. This collection still has the signature Merabi glamour seen in the sequins, tailoring, and new fringe detailing.</p><h3 dir=ltr>Could you highlight any specific design elements or details that are unique to this resort collection and reflect your creative vision?</h3><p id=epnV92g-Wpx data-wc=49>A lot of our embellishment work is very unique to this Resort collection. The <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Piper suits</a> feature an embroidered lace mesh trouser with a statement oriental pattern and the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Nikita</a> features multicoloured 3D flower sequin hand-embellished floral patterns. I really got to experiment and have fun designing this collection.</p><h3 dir=ltr>What type of woman did you have in mind when designing this resort collection, and how does it align with your brand's target audience?</h3><p id=edJaYwO6qjg data-wc=50>The Merabi woman is someone who likes to feel special. She expresses herself through statement pieces, she doesn’t want to be like everyone else. She likes to travel and has an air of confidence about her when she wears pieces she loves. I definitely think this aligns with our audience.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fe47dac6b837-nadine-merabi-portrait-1.jpg><h3 dir=ltr>What’s next for Nadine Merabi?</h3><p id=e3zObhK-vI0c data-wc=56>I would love to venture more into accessories in the future to be able to offer a complete look from head to toe. One thing I can promise you is that the glitz and glam isn’t going anywhere. I have so many different things in the works right now that I’m so excited to show you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue5Nyb25rYmS7orDIp5xmpZWnrqO1jKKqZq6Vo8G2vsinnmanpal6sLKMqZirrKlixKat0WaYp5xdnbKzsYytpmaemaG5bsXOrqlmr5ikuaZ51pqpnaqfl7Jw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
