There is a minimum and a maximum IP address your network can use. This is the scope or range of IP addresses for your network. We will need to provide IP addresses or a range of IP addresses to <code>nmap</code>, so we need to know what those values are.</p><p>Handily, Linux provides a command called <code>ip</code> and <a href=#>it has an option</a> called <code>addr</code> (address). Type <code>ip</code>, a space, <code>addr</code>, and press Enter.</p><pre>ip addr</pre><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nmap_18.png><p>In the bottom section of the output, you will find your ip address.

The "/24" means that there are three consecutive sets of eight 1's in the subnet mask. (And 3 x 8 =24.)</p><p>In binary, the subnet mask is:</p><pre>11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000</pre><p>and in decimal, it is 255.255.255.0.</p><p>The subnet mask and the IP address are used to indicate which part of the IP address identifies the network, and which part identifies the device. This subnet mask informs the hardware that the first three numbers of the IP address will identify the network and the last part of the IP address identifies the individual devices. And because the largest number you can hold in an 8-bit binary number is 255, the IP address range for this network will be 192.168.4.0 through to 192.168.4.255.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All of that is encapsulated in the "/24". Happily, <code>nmap</code> works with that notation, so we have what we need to start to use <code>nmap</code>.</p><h2 id=get-started-with-nmap>Get Started with nmap</h2><p><code>nmap</code> is a <a href=#>network mapping tool</a>. It works by sending various network messages to the IP addresses in the range we're going to provide it with it. It can deduce a lot about the device it is probing by judging and interpreting the type of responses it gets.</p><p>Let's kick off a simple scan with <code>nmap</code>. We're going to use the <code>-sn</code> (scan no port) option. This tells <code>nmap</code> to not probe the ports on the devices for now. It will do a lightweight, quick scan.</p><p>Even so, it can take a little time for <code>nmap</code> to run. Of course, the more devices you have on the network, the longer it will take. It does all of its probing and reconnaissance work first and then presents its findings once the first phase is complete. Don't be surprised when nothing visible happens for a minute or so.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The IP address we're going to use is the one we obtained using the <code>ip</code> command earlier, but the final number is set to zero. That is the first possible IPAddress on this network. The "/24" tells <code>nmap</code> to scan the entire range of this network. The parameter "192.168.4.0/24" translates as "start at IP address 192.168.4.0 and work right through all IP addresses up to and including 192.168.4.255".</p><p>Note we are using <code>sudo</code>.</p><pre>sudo nmap -sn 192.168.4.0/24</pre><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nmap_2.png><p>After a short wait, the output is written to the terminal window.</p><p>You can run this scan without using <code>sudo</code>, but using <code>sudo</code> ensures it can extract as much information as possible. Without <code>sudo</code> this scan would not return the manufacturer information, for example.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nmap_11.png><p>The advantage of using the <code>-sn</code> option — as well as being a quick and lightweight scan — is it gives you a neat list of the live IP addresses. In other words, we have a list of the devices connected to the network, together with their IP address. And where possible, <code>nmap</code> has identified the manufacturer. That's not bad for the first try.</p><p>Here's the bottom of the list.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nmap_2.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We've established a list of the connected network devices, so we know how many of them there are. There are 15 devices switched on and connected to the network. We know the manufacturer for some of them. Or, as we shall see, we have what <code>nmap</code> has reported as the manufacturer, to the best of its ability.</p><p>When you look through your results, you will likely see devices that you recognize. There may well be some that you don't. These are the ones we need to investigate further.</p><p>What some of these devices are is clear to me. Raspberry Pi Foundation is self-explanatory. The Amazon Technologies device will be my Echo Dot. The only Samsung device I have is a laser printer, so that narrows that one down. There's a couple of devices listed as manufactured by Dell. Those are easy, that's a PC and laptop. The Avaya device is a Voice Over IP phone that provides me with an extension on the telephone system at head office. It allows them to pester me at home more easily, so I'm well aware of that device.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But I'm still left with questions.</p><p>There are several devices with names that don't mean anything to me all. Liteon technology and Elitegroup Computer systems, for example.</p><p>I have (way) more than one Raspberry PI. How many are connected to the network will always vary because they're continually swapped in and out of duty as they get re-imaged and re-purposed. But definitely, there should be more than one showing up.</p><p>There are a couple of devices marked as Unknown. Obviously, they'll need looking into.</p><h2 id=perform-a-deeper-scan>Perform a Deeper Scan</h2><p>If we remove the <code>-sn</code> option <code>nmap</code> will also try to probe the ports on the devices. Ports are numbered endpoints for network connections on devices. Consider an apartment block. All the apartments have the same street address (the equivalent of the IP address), but each apartment has its own number (the equivalent of the port).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Each program or service within a device has a port number. Network traffic is delivered to an IP address and a port, not just to an IP address. Some port numbers are preallocated, or reserved. They are always used to carry network traffic of a specific type. Port 22, for example, <a href=#>is reserved for SSH connections</a> and port 80 is reserved for HTTP web traffic.</p><p>We are going to use <code>nmap</code> to scan the ports on each device and tells which ones are open.</p><p>nmap 192.168.4.0/24</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nmap_32.png><p>This time we're getting a more detailed summary of each device. We're told there are 13 active devices on the network. Wait a minute; we had 15 devices a moment ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The number of devices may well vary as you run these scans. It is likely due to mobile devices arriving and leaving the premises, or equipment being turned on and off. Also, be aware that when you switch on a device that has been powered off, it might not have the same IP address as it did the last time it was in use. it might, but it might not.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nmap_33-1.png><p>There was a lot of output.

It will be running one Linux distribution or another. So what is using port 445? It is described as "microsoft-ds". Microsoft, on a Pi running Linux? We'll certainly be looking into that.</p><p>192.168.4.11 was tagged as "Unknown" in the earlier scan.

But that Pi and device 192.168.4.21 both have port 8888 open, which is described as being used by "sun-answerbook". Sun AnswerBook is a many-years retired (elementary) documentation retrieval system. Needless to say, I don't have that installed anywhere. That needs looking at.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nmap_39.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Device 192.168.4.22 was identified earlier as a Samsung printer, which is verified here by the tag that says "printer". What caught my eye was the HTTP port 80 being present and open. This port is reserved for website traffic. Does my printer incorporate a website?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nmap_40.png><p>Device 192.168.4.31 is reportedly manufactured by a company called Elitegroup Computer Systems. I've never heard of them, and the device has a lot of ports open, so we'll be looking into that.</p><p>The more ports a device has open, the more chances a cybercriminal has of getting into it — if it is exposed directly to the Internet that is. It's like a house. The more doors and windows you have, the more potential points of entry a burglar has.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nmap_41-2.png><h2 id=we-39-ve-lined-up-the-suspects-let-39-s-make-them-talk>We've Lined Up The Suspects; Let's Make Them Talk</h2><p>Device 192.168.4.10 is a Raspberry Pi that has port 445 open, which is described as "microsoft-ds." A quick bit of Internet searching reveals that port 445 is usually associated with Samba. Samba is a <a href=#>free software implementation</a> of Microsoft's Server Message Block protocol (SMB). SMB is a means of sharing folders and files across a network.</p><p>This makes sense; I use that particular Pi as a sort of mini-Network Attached Storage device (NAS). It uses Samba so that I can connect to it from any computer on my network. Ok, that was easy. One down, several more to go.</p><h2 id=unknown-device-with-many-open-ports>Unknown Device With Many Open Ports</h2><p>The device with IP Address 192.168.4.11 had an unknown manufacturer and a lot of ports open.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We can use <code>nmap</code> more aggressively to try to winkle more information out of the device. The <code>-A</code> (aggressive scan) option forces <code>nmap</code> to use operating system detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute detection.</p><p>The <code>-T</code> (timing template) option allows us to specify a value from 0 to 5. This sets one of the timing modes. The timing modes have great names: paranoid (0), sneaky (1), polite (2), normal (3), aggressive (4), and insane (5). The lower the number, the less impact <code>nmap</code> will have on the bandwidth and other network users.</p><p>Note that we're not providing <code>nmap</code> with an IP range. We're focussing <code>nmap</code> on a single IP address, which is the IP address of the device in question.</p><pre>sudo nmap -A -T4 192.168.4.11</pre><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nmap_42-1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the machine used to research this article, it took nine minutes for <code>nmap</code> to execute that command.

On my network that isn't a great surprise, but this version of Linux is odd. It seems to be quite old. Linux is used within almost all of the Internet of Things devices, so that might be a clue.</p><p>Further down in the output <code>nmap</code> gave us the <a href=#>Media Access Control address</a> (MAC address) of the device. This is a unique reference that is assigned to network interfaces.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first three bytes of the MAC address is known as the <a href=#>Organizationally Unique Identifier</a> (OUI).

The IP address that is now missing from the second set of results will be the device you just powered off.</p><h2 id=sun-answerbook>Sun AnswerBook?</h2><p>The next mystery was the "sun-answerbook" description for the Raspberry Pi with IP address 192.168.4.18. The same "sun-answerbook" description was showing up for the device at 192.168.4.21. Device 192.168.4.21 is a Linux desktop computer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><code>nmap</code> makes its best guess at the use of a port from a list of known software associations. Of course, if any of these port associations are no longer applicable — perhaps the software is no longer in use and has gone <a href=#>end of life</a> — you can get misleading port descriptions in your scan results. That was likely the case here, the Sun AnswerBook system dates back to the early 1990's, and is nothing more than a distant memory — to those who've even heard of it.</p><p>So, if it isn't some ancient <a href=#>Sun Microsystems</a> software, so what could these two devices, the Raspberry Pi and the desktop, have in common?</p><p>Internet searches didn't bring anything back that was useful. There were a lot of hits. It seems anything with a web interface that doesn't want to use port 80 seems to opt for port 8888 as a fallback. So the next logical step was to try to connect to that port using a browser.</p><p>I used 192.168.4.18:8888 as an address in my browser. This is the format to specify an IP address and a port in a browser. Use a colon <code>:</code> to separate the IP address from the port number.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nmap_46.png><p>A web site did indeed open up.</p><p>It is the admin portal for any devices that are running <a href=#>Resilio Sync</a>.</p><p>I always use the command line, so I'd completely forgotten about this facility.

Again, I took the IP address from the <code>nmap</code> results and used it as an address in my browser.

Another command that is useful in pinning down the identity of the devices on your network is <code>arp</code>. <code>arp</code> is used to work with the Address Resolution Protocol table in your Linux computer. It is used to translate from an <a href=#>IP address (or network name) to a MAC address</a>.</p><p>If <code>arp</code> is not installed on your computer, you can install it like this.</p><p>On Ubuntu, use <code>apt-get</code> :</p><pre>sudo apt-get install net-tools</pre><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nmap_2.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Fedora use <code>dnf</code> :</p><pre>sudo dnf install net-tools</pre><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>On Manjaro use <code>pacman</code> :</p><pre>sudo pacman -Syu net-tools</pre><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>To get a list of the devices and their network names — if they've been assigned one — just type <code>arp</code> and press Enter.</p><p>This is the output from my research machine:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The names in the first column are the machine names (also called hostnames or network names) that have been assigned to the devices.

Because the MAC addresses for the devices are listed, we can refer to the output from <code>nmap</code> to further identify the devices.</p><p>Also, because you can use a machine name with <code>ping</code> and because <code>ping</code> displays the underlying IP address, you can cross-reference machine names to IP addresses by using <code>ping</code> on each name in turn.</p><p>For example, let's ping Nostromo.local and find out what its IP address is.

In this case, it is a Liteon Wi-Fi card inside an Asus laptop. So, as we noted earlier, the name of the manufacturer that is returned by <code>nmap</code> is just its best guess. How was <code>nmap</code> to know the Liteon Wi-Fi card was fitted to an Asus laptop?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And finally. The MAC address for the device manufactured by Elitegroup Computer Systems matches the one in the <code>arp</code> listing for the device I have named LibreELEC.local.</p><p>This is an <a href=#>Intel NUC</a>, running the <a href=#>LibreELEC media player</a>.

You can use the techniques described here to investigate your network either. You may do this out of interest — to satisfy your inner geek — or to satisfy yourself that everything connected to your network has a right to be there.</p><p>Remember that connected devices come in all shapes and sizes.
