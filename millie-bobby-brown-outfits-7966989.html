Over the past eight years, fans have watched the now 19 year old emerge from the small screen to the big screen, launch her affordable beauty brand, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>florence by mills</a>, and even get engaged to Jake Bongiovi. We’ve also had the pleasure of watching her style evolve from super cute to incredibly chic, as Brown's outfits have gotten progressively more stylish — and mature — over the years.&nbsp;</p><p>Brown dresses in a way that is entirely her own. Even when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Brown posed for InStyle in 2017</a> —&nbsp;when she was just 13 — she had been pursued by brands like Coach, Louis Vuitton, Calvin Klein, and Converse. She was an actress, yes, but also a budding model, and campaign frontwoman. “Modeling is very close to my heart,” she said at the time. “I feel like just taking pictures is amazing. You’ll feel if you did a good job in that shoot — or if you feel like you haven’t, then you haven’t. But some pictures turn out to be iconic, and it means so much.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One thing's for sure: Her style is already iconic. Ahead, we’ve rounded up 14 of our favorite Millie Bobby Brown outfits, from the red carpet, interviews, and beyond.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-moment-in-moschino></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Moment in Moschino</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jun Sato/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brown attended Osaka Comic Con 2023 in Osaka, Japan, and served up some truly *chef's kiss* looks, one of them being this black number by Moschino. The dress flaunts a crinkled texture with a fun bubble skirt and bedazzled button detail down the front. The dress stands as a statement all its own, so Brown opted for minimal accessories: silver pumps to match her silver hoop earrings, and, of course, her beautiful engagement ring.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lady-in-red></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Lady in Red</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jun Sato/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another look from Brown’s appearance at Osaka Comic Con was this red-hot ensemble consisting of micro-mini shorts, a crop top, and coordinating jacket. The actress looks phenomenal in head-to-toe crimson and chunky rhinestones, offering fans an outfit that is, essentially, a masterclass in how-to monochrome, down to the matching cowgirl boots. Again, she keeps her accessories subtle — hoops and her engagement ring — and throws her hair in a bun, ensuring all eyes were on her outfit.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-schoolcore-chic></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Schoolcore Chic</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>MEGA/GC Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This look from Brown is a personal favorite. It’s giving <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>schoolcore</a> but at the post-grad level. We don’t know what aspect of the ensemble we love more: the crisp, cropped, and collared button-down, the silk suspenders, or the combination thereof. The 19 year old finished off with sleek black stilettos and a handbag.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-elevated-neutrals></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Elevated Neutrals</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Todd Owyoung/NBC via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to promote Enola Holmes 2, Brown donned a chic yet laid-back ensemble that’s easy to replicate. Though the actress was, of course, wearing designer (specifically Celine), you don’t need thousands of dollars to get the look. Instead, all you need is a black top (Brown wears a corset style, but you could swap for a tank or well-made T-shirt), grey trousers, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>brown leather jacket</a>, and chunky black pumps.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-casual-cool></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Casual Cool</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Courtney Kiefer/Disney via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On a Disney date with fiancé Jake, the couple posed with a pair of Storm Troopers. Naturally, Brown’s maxi-length dress with pops of orange and green stood out against the black-and-white backdrop of the Star Wars theme park, but we’re not complaining. The one-and-done piece (which Brown paired with comfy black FILA sneakers) is a WeWoreWhat original. Sadly, the dress is no longer available, but there are plenty of similar styles on the market (like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>this one from Cider</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>this one from Rihoas</a>).&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-little-black-set></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Little Black Set</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Samsung</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rather than sport a traditional LBD for the Samsung 2022 Galaxy Creators Lounge Event, Brown opted for a two-piece ensemble. The top was a lacy black peplum number with a plunging neckline. It appeared a bit oversized and slouchy but looked effortlessly chic tucked into a black mini skirt that also featured lace detailing at the hem. Accessories were kept to a minimum (per usual): huggie earrings, a dainty necklace, a single bangle bracelet, and strappy heels for footwear.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-red-carpet-glamour></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Red Carpet Glamour</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Roy Rochlin/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Brown hit the carpet for the Netflix premiere of Stranger Things season 4, jaws dropped. Her Louis Vuitton gown remains, arguably, one of the actress’s best looks. From its dramatic thigh-high slit to its sheer one-shoulder detail and chunky belt, the floor-length gown was glamorous and really showed just how much the actress had grown during her time as Eleven.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mesh-and-lace></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Mesh and Lace</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jeff Spicer/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the 2022 BAFTA Awards in London, Brown arrived all decked out in lacy mesh and velvet. Though the actress appeared to be wearing an evening gown, it was actually an illusion; the look was a three-piece ensemble consisting of a plunging v-neck top with a bandeau underneath and a maxiskirt. Though we love a chainlink necklace, the real star of Brown’s accessories on this night was her pair of black <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>opera gloves</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-head-to-toe-tartan></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Head-to-Toe Tartan</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Netflix</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As far as we’re concerned, plaid will never go out of style, and this look from Brown is proof. Professional yet playful, chic but not stuffy, the asymmetrical top and trousers was yet another example of Brown’s style evolution in front of our eyes. To round out the look, Brown opted for nude heels and a sleek, high ponytail.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-elegant-in-white></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Elegant in White</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another monochromatic moment for Millie. When Brown walked the carpet at the 2020 SAG Awards, critics were quick to, well, critique the then-15-year-old’s Louis Vuitton two-piece suit, claiming the all-white ensemble was too “mature” for the actress. We disagree (add it to the list of young women Hollywood doesn’t want to see dress how they please). Brown looked fabulous in the matching trousers and silk taffeta coat-dress. “I definitely wanted to go for more of a masculine but very feminine look.” Brown <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told </a><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>People</a> of her vision at the time, “[The designers] got it just right, as usual.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-everything-olive></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Everything Olive</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Steven Ferdman/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Black and white looks may be classic, but there’s no denying Brown looks exceptional in bold colorways as well. Take, for example, this olive-all-over ensemble she wore to the 2019 WWD Beauty Inc Awards. The slip dress was playful, while the oversized blazer gave stylish professionalism. Her slightly messy topknot added a casual element to the finished look, as did the addition of dainty accessories.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bold-florals></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Bold Florals</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images for Beach House Group.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brown loves a floral print as much as we do, and this mini shirt dress decked out in flower print is one of our favorites from the actress’s earlier archives. It also goes to show she isn’t afraid to mix and match prints, as she opted for black-and-white polka-dot pointed flats for footwear.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-poised-in-plaid></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Poised in Plaid</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Neil Mockford/GC Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Heading into an on-air interview with KISS FM UK back in 2019, Brown was spotted in a plaid-centric ensemble. Though the interview took place in May of that year, the color scheme of black, grey, and maroon channeled early fall, and we are here for that kind of seasonal inspiration as we move into autumn. The miniskirt and blazer communicated that she’s serious about her work, but the combat boots and newsboy cap showed she was starting to experiment with her accessories and finding her personal style.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-stepping-out-in-statement-coats></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Stepping Out in Statement Coats</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>MIGUEL MEDINA/AFP via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s unclear if Brown meant to channel Ariana Grande for her 2019 Moncler women's Fall/Winter 2019/2020 collection fashion show look, but there’s no denying the similarities, like the super high bubble ponytail and oversized vinyl jacket worn slouched down one shoulder. Brown also took a page from Grande’s lampshading playbook, with a black hoodie dress and tights underneath the sporty coat (which was adorned with patches).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zKKjpaGVYq%2BwrsGyZJuqn6y7brvUrZ2irKNihHqClXJvcg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
