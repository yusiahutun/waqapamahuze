Kentex Cargo Kenya has received a lot of positive reviews from users with most people expressing satisfaction. There are a few complaints regarding the charges, but this is due to the confusion between actual weight and volumetric weight. The difference is that bulky products (volumetric/dimensional weight) may cost more when shipped by air. Also, the higher weight of the two is used when pricing. Besides the little complaints, Kentex prides itself on a 100% delivery record.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhsaq5a8s2ldlc.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Top Shipping Companies in Kenya this 2018</strong></p><h2>Location</h2><p class=align-left>Kentex Cargo is located in Dallas Texas.
