The plan outlined jobs growth in fields concerning people’s livelihood and grass-roots stability.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China broadly divides staff on the government payroll into two categories: administrative officials in government agencies, known as xingzheng bianzhi, and staff serving in other public institutions, such as schools, hospitals, broadcasting, city management and social welfare, known as shiye bianzhi.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Henan government said its restructuring plan for public institutions, or shiye danwei, would not affect those working for schools and hospitals.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Henan official involved in the downsizing exercise said key headcount reduction methods would not involve mass retrenchments.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have tightened the staffing quota of each unit. Depending on the severity of overstaffing, we will tell them they can only recruit one for every two or three retirements or resignations. So after a few years, they will hit the target number,” he said on condition of anonymity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“No doubt, the workload on each head will increase and we have heard complaints.

The job security made the public sector the most sought-after employer in China now and people tend to stay in the system until retirement, given the rising unemployment,” Wu said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In one of Henan’s official newspapers, an editorial worker said that despite his unit pursuing the “one recruitment for every two retirements policy”, they had not replaced the two retirees in his office because of a lack of funds in the budget.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our office is getting older, we were told no fresh blood will join us in the near future,” he said, adding that they now employed contract workers or freelancers to help ease the workload, but they did not usually stay long because their pay and medical benefits were less than those offered to permanent workers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The trimming of the workforce in Henan is a sign of Beijing’s determination to push for public institution reform in all provinces following a four-year trial in selected provinces and cities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Central Commission for Comprehensively Deepening Reform – China’s top decision-making body on institutional reforms led by President Xi Jinping – approved a pilot plan for public institution reform in February 2020.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It asked five provinces – Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Jiangxi and Shandong – to make changes in provincewide public institutions, while four other provinces, including Jiangsu, were asked to choose cities to be pilot zones.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/03/15/150324-clean-chung-yan-CLE.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">34:00</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">‘Two sessions’: China’s economic and diplomatic challenges | Talking Post with Yonden Lhatoo</p><p>‘Two sessions’: China’s economic and diplomatic challenges | Talking Post with Yonden Lhatoo</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to media reports, the pilot provinces focused on merging noncore public functions, including official media outlets, city administration or chengguang, and geological exploration units, to make staff cuts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In October 2021, Heilongjiang reported streamlining 2,735 public institutions and cutting more than 83,000 “headcount” from public institutions, while in eastern China, Jiangsu province reported a cut of more than 40 per cent reduction in municipal institutions in four pilot cities, cutting more than 9,500 jobs in 2022.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wu said the latest round of austerity efforts might not necessarily mean the number of Chinese civil servants would fall.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is no conclusive evidence on China’s civil service trend. But official statistics on the workforce under government payroll seems to be gradually rising since Xi came to power in 2012, because Xi needs to deploy more hands to ensure stability,” he said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘I’ve shed all idealistic work expectations’: China’s jobseekers face reality</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Based on numbers from the National Bureau of Statistics, the number of urban employees in public administration, social security and other organisations rose from 15.4 million in 2012 to nearly 20 million in 2022. The percentage of public sector employees in total urban employment rose from 10 per cent to 12 per cent in the same period.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wu noted that the tight government budget – resulting from weaker land sale revenue and an overall softening of economic activity – might be a compelling reason for the Chinese government to freeze its headcounts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2023, all mainland provinces and municipalities except for Fujian province registered a budget deficit. Henan had 451 billion yuan (US$62 billion) income, but expenditure amounted to 1.106 trillion yuan (US$152 billion), leaving a staggering 655 billion yuan (US$90 billion) deficit, according to its provincial government work report.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyxu8uiq6Kbo2Sus8DInKOeZ2Nng3J%2Fkm9mnKCZo660ec%2Brpq%2BhnpiytHnTq6CmZaSdvLa%2FwKebrGWXpMOmvs2mnKesXZ%2B8o7%2BMrKeeppRiurC%2BxGaZnqGanruov4ysmqKdnpiybq3NnWScp56pv7C4jKmpoqeinsGqsdI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
