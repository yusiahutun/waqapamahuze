She was born on September 12, 2014.</p><p>“Ryan is madly in love with the baby,” an insider told People shortly after her birth. “[Mendes is] absolutely in heaven being a mom. She’s never been happier … She and Ryan are just in awe of this beautiful person they created. It’s a really special time for them.”</p><p>Mendes told <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.byrdie.com/eva-mendes-zoom-date-5525214 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Byrdie</a> in 2022, “I really feel like when we’re bored — not stimulated by a phone, or an iPad, or computer or television — that’s when ideas come in. Sometimes it’s fun, sometimes it’s dangerous, and sometimes it’s enlightening. I really want it to be the summer of boredom.”</p><p>She praised her daughters’ craft skills during their young years. “Right now, they have every bug,” she said of their daughters’ interests. “They just like a lot of arts and crafts, a lot of painting. We have instruments around. They pick them up, and we can’t say they actually play anything, but you know, it’s just a playful environment, and it’s a lot of fun but who knows?”</p><p>Another fun fact about the little one is that she <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lifestyle/zodiac/1356666/zodiac-signs-the-notebook/ rel="noreferrer noopener">is bilingual</a>. “Esmeralda mostly speaks Spanglish right now. It’s really cute. She’s definitely bilingual, and it’s really important for us to make sure that she’s not only just familiar with the language, but also with the culture,” Mendes told <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/movies/margot-robbie-ryan-gosling-barbie.html rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a>. “My mom, who lives 15 minutes away, makes it easy because she speaks to the girls in Spanish and cooks them Cuban food. And we’re always listening to Cuban music. It really is a big part of our way of life. I wouldn’t have it any other way.”</p><p>Though she lovingly shares their habits to the press or social media, she won’t post pictures of them without their consent. “My man and kids are private,” the actress said in a response to an <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/B_IiLgMDt-v/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram comment,</a> adding that she will only share photos of them that are already available online as “flashbacks.” “That’s important to me so thanks for getting that.”</p><p>“Oh gosh, it’s so fun and beautiful and maddening. It’s maddening,” she told Access Hollywood. “It’s so hard, of course. But it’s like that feeling of like, really, you end your day, you put them to bed, and Ryan and I kind of look at each other like, ‘We did it, we did it. We came out relatively unscathed, you know?’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfp8aiuoygpqykmaO0brfInapo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
