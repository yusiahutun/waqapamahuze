Read on for insider details.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Disjointed?</h2><p>Disjointed&nbsp;is an American comedy created by a former writer for The Daily Show with Jon Stuart, David Javerbaum, and longtime comedy generator Chuck Lorre. You might know him as the creator of shows such as&nbsp;The Big Bang Theory,&nbsp;Mike and Molly, and&nbsp;Two and a half men.&nbsp;</p><p><a data-amazonimages title="Disjointed (Music from the Netflix Original Series)" href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514hmOkDOTL._SL500_.jpg alt="Disjointed (Music from the Netflix Original Series)" title="Disjointed (Music from the Netflix Original Series)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The show’s creators delivered a 20-episode order which premiered on streaming giant Netflix on August 25, 2017, with its storyline pretty much focused on weed.</p><p>The sitcom stars two-time Emmy award-winning Kathy Bates as the central character, Ruth Whitefeather Feldman. Ruth Feldman is an old-school hippie who runs a medical marijuana dispensary and advocates for legalization.&nbsp;</p><p><a data-amazonimages title="Posterazzi Poster Print Kathy Bates At Arrivals For 57Th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards The Shrine Auditorium Los Angeles Ca September 18 2005.

Directly after&nbsp;Disjointed’s&nbsp;cancellation, Lorre signed a deal for a new sitcom on Netflix as per high times.&nbsp;</p><p><a data-amazonimages title="Richard Jewell" href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51XfBUYocWL._SL500_.jpg alt="Richard Jewell" title="Richard Jewell" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The show’s star Kathy Bates featured on other projects, including Clint Eastwood’s new drama called&nbsp;Richard Jewell, for which she received an Oscar nomination.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmsKCpYrGqsIydoKyin567tbHDZp6erF2Yrq%2BvxKWjnpxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
