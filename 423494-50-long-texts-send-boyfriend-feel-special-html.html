Both people might not have calmed down to have a face to face conversation; hence messaging becomes the perfect platform to initiate reconciliation. In your part, look for long paragraphs to copy and paste and send to your boyfriend as an <a href=#>apology</a>.</p><ul><li>Fighting with the person I love is the hardest thing I have done, and I did not enjoy any part of it. When our relationship doesn't have harmony, my heart is robbed of happiness and peace. I am willing to do anything to ensure nothing ever comes between us again.</li><li>Even though my words were mean, I had no intention to hurt you. I have now realised that my reactions were not only uncalculated but also unreasonable. I seek your forgiveness and take back my words because I want this relationship to work.</li><li>We are lucky that what we had was just another fight but not another breakup. However, we need to start looking out for each other more because these fights make us drift apart. Being away from you for such a short time reminds me that I cannot survive without you.</li><li>I apologise for my silly actions and promise always to be patient when things are not going my way. I am tired of us having to fight over every little thing. Our love and strength are put to the test in such times; hence we need to be there for each other now than ever.</li><li>Despite our constant fights, I love you more than anything in the world. You are the source of my joy and being with you gives me immense happiness. So I wouldn't let any fight come between us, my love.</li><li>Darling, we still can have happy moments because we have all it takes to be satisfied. You bring to life all my fantasies, and I am delighted to call you my man. I wouldn't let our constant fights take you away from me. My heart has chosen you, and so I shall abide.</li><li>During times like these, we ought to be there for one another because we have always promised to be there for each other. But, instead, every time we fight, I am left alone to the sad awakening that I can't do without you. You fill my world with sweet and fun memories. I want my man back!</li><li>I am sorry about my part in our fight. Even though it is not a problem we can solve with text messages, I missed you and couldn't wait till I see you. Can we meet later?</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/52d23a3557f845c1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to make a girl laugh over text: 100+ funny things to say to a girl</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c47f8a3ed8840892.jpg><ul><li>Even though we both lost our tempers and said things that we regret, I applaud you for being the bigger person and walking away. However, your absence has left a massive hole in my heart. I am sorry for my part and am ready to talk. Let's meet.</li><li>I feel silly for taking you for granted when all you have done is to make me happy. I am sorry for the fight we had and promise to learn to value you more from now on. Call me when you get the chance so that we can talk.</li><li>I don't know if there are any rules on what to text your boyfriend after an argument, and I am not even sure what to say except that I am sorry. But, darling, you mean the world to me, and I would love to have a chance to make it up to you.</li><li>Just like our love has been able to conquer all our past disagreements, I hope we will make it past this one too. I am fully committed to working it out, and I know you are too. So please come back to me, my darling.</li><li>I know our fight didn't give you much reason to continue loving me.

Your love is like a rocket that takes me to outer space, and it is a feeling I won't trade for anything. I hope nothing will ever separate us because it will kill me not waking up to your beautiful face and tender kisses.</li><li>Nothing can measure the depth of my love for you because it runs more profound than the deepest ocean in the world. Nothing can measure up to what you mean to me, for you are my entire world. You have made my life better, and I hope my kisses every morning will be able to pay for that.</li><li>You are the best thing that has ever happened in my life. If I had to think of something even more beautiful, it would be you when you smile. Each morning I thank God for bringing you into my life. I am proud that I have an angel to call my love.</li><li>You are the most remarkable poem I have ever encountered. You mean the world to me, and I can't let the world take you away from me. No one else deserves the love I have, for my love for you is limitless. I may not explain why I love you, but I know that without you, my life has no purpose.</li><li>A part of me was missing, and I knew I had found it when I first saw you. When I saw you smile at me, my heart raced, and something inside told me you are the one for me. There is nothing I yearn for more than to see us growing old together.</li><li>My heart flutters at the thought of the amazing love you have given me. When I imagine us growing old together, my heart leaps, and I find myself blushing. Saying I love you alone doesn't seem enough anymore. I want this feeling to last for an eternity.</li><li>I don’t know if I’d know how to love another person the way I love you because you represent the meaning of life to me. I will always cherish you, just as I cherish my own life. You have made my happiness your priority, and for that, I promise to be there for you in every challenge.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f41cb98f622473ce.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>120+ deep love messages for him to make him feel adored</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c47f8a3ed8840892.jpg><ul><li>Your precious love has been a blessing to me, and I will forever be thankful to God for that. I can't wait for the moment when we will both say 'for better for worse. My vow is to continue loving you until my last breath.</li><li>The sun brightens the day, the moon brightens the night, but you are more critical because you brighten both my days and nights. Like flower blossoms in the summer's sunshine, I will make sure you always get the best of me. You will forever be my best man.</li><li>You came into my world and lightened it up.

I will always love you regardless of the challenges that may come our way.</li><li>Believe me when I tell you that your love means more than just a word to me. It is so alive that it cannot be separated from who I am. You have loved me so intensely that I cannot get enough of it.</li><li>I see you when I close my eyes.

When you are away, your memories help me stay strong until I can see you.</li><li>You are the kindest and most caring man I have ever encountered, and it makes me wonder what life would be like without you. You are my hero and role model. If I were asked to choose only two moments to be with you, I would say now and forever.</li><li>You have caged my heart in a way that it will never break. In return, I promise that my smile for you will never fade. I hope that, like those two things, our love for each other will never end.
