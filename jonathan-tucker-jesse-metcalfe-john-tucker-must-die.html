During two separate interviews, they shared the same story of one very random run-in with the other.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/57/16by9/2021/03/08/57ee4e5523a24848a375c348ce8f22fa_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>"The actor, the real John Tucker, I ran into him on the street in Vancouver one time and were both [working] on different projects in Canada," explained Metcalfe. "He told me that being named John Tucker was the bane of his existence because everyone was, you know, always referencing that movie when they met him."</p><p>In case you forgot the plot of the movie, the titular character is a high school jock who's caught three-timing a trio of girls. After discovering his cheating ways, they hatch a revenge plot and, at one point, even start spreading a lie that he has herpes.</p><p>Not exactly the ideal person with whom to share a name, right?</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f107384c-becf-4d59-b67d-e4ab29aa8087 data-container-ref=toofab:article:e2578fb4-de2c-4c1a-80a1-6051a562e5d3 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/06/5by4/2021/03/04/068d0fa79a564adfab9852f8685a8316_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">NBC/TooFab</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Debris' Jonathan Tucker Assures 'Concerned' Viewers They'll Be 'Satisfied' (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Jesse Metcalfe must die," the real Tucker said with a laugh when we brought up the film during an interview. "Anytime I get it, it's annoying," he added, in good fun.</p><p>"The movie holds up. I was actually up here in Vancouver when he was shooting," Tucker continued, "and I bumped into him on the street, you son of a gun, you're out here dragging my name through the street."</p><p>All jokes aside, Tucker also had some pretty great things to say about Metcalfe and how he's been open about rehab and sobriety in the public eye.</p><p>"He's gone through a pretty substantial arc in his life, his sobriety has been inspiring to a lot of people and he's been able to find his authentic self, which is ultimately what we're trying to do as actors, as storytellers, as human beings," said Tucker.</p><p>"Our creative source, our gut instinct is the only thing that separates us from anybody else and we put up all this dissonance between what we're feeling and the decisions we end up making and when you eliminate that, magical things happen," he continued -- before adding, "and it sounds like it's happening for him and he clearly did it on the back of my good name."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a2db6a9f-3b27-490f-a488-c76f2387fad9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:e2578fb4-de2c-4c1a-80a1-6051a562e5d3 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/71/5by4/2020/08/25/71d1bb3a6bca435c8ecf344c56a93a7a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Vertical Entertainment</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Why Jesse Metcalfe Doesn't Want to Be an Action Hero (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j2xmaXBfn7yvrdOhmKdlpKqwrLHRZqGeq6Oaeq6x05yYpZ6VYrewtM1mq66bm5q%2FbrnUrKtmnJmafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
