He was 52 while Tsu was 24. Despite their age gap, the couple’s relationship worked because of the similarities of their humor.</p><p>“I was a meditating, vegetarian hippie, and he was a meat-eating, boozing, ultra-famous person. But I made him laugh a lot. I brought him an elaborate train set from Japan, and we spent hours putting it together, rolling on the floor, laughing and eating popcorn.”</p><p>Nonetheless, humor alone can’t tie a relationship together. They both knew marriage wasn’t an option for them at the time.
