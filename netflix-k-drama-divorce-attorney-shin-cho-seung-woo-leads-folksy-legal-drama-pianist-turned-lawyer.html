He has never lost one and they rarely go to court. In fact, he normally gets what his clients want before the mediation stage is over.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Given his skills, this lawyer’s name seems particularly apt – in Korean, shinsunghan means “sacred”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Prospective clients delight in seeing the shingle “Sacred Attorney”, though they are taken aback after they step into his cramped and humble office, which is full of wooden panels, stacks of legal reports and a sliding door that keeps getting stuck.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">7 of the best new Korean drama series to look out for in March 2023</span></p></a></h3>Sung-han’s office manager is the loyal Jang Hyeong-geun (<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Kim Sung-kyun</span></a>). One morning in the office, the latter talks to Sung-han about his favourite radio DJ, Lee Seo-jin (Han Hye-jin), who has just been kicked off the air following a scandal.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mid-conversation, Sung-han’s secretary ushers in a new client – and Hyeong-geun’s jaw drops when his DJ crush walks in through the door.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition to losing her job, Seo-jin is also about to lose her husband and child. She was caught having an affair in the most public way possible – her lover leaked a sex tape of them online.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/08/caf4022e-8689-440e-8963-5a938b4c4517_3c73495e.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Vaguely familiar with the scandal, Sung-han initially balks at the seemingly unwinnable case. Seo-jin assures him that she does not want any money out of the divorce; all she cares about is getting custody of her young son.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her simply stated but clearly passionate desire moves something within Sung-han and he takes on the difficult case. His sudden change of heart leads us to realise that Seo-jin’s desire to keep her son connects to something in Sung-han’s past.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Seo-jin may have had an affair, but it is soon revealed that she is leading the life of a terrorised prisoner thanks to her monstrous husband.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He insists that she constantly record her goings-on outside the house, takes photos of her underwear drawer every day and has cameras in the house.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/08/40aa897e-f124-44e5-8866-5955fd89c573_321877de.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sung-han may be a successful divorce lawyer now, but his legal career began very late. Earlier in life he was a gifted pianist and, even later, a music professor living in Germany.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We do not know what prompted Sung-han’s career change, but his happy-go-lucky persona appears to be masking a pain connected to his past. The folksy trot singing and soju swilling seduces the audience while also manifesting as a pattern of behaviour that has emerged as he attempts to escape past trauma.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Whether in his car alone or in impromptu karaoke sessions with Hyeong-geun and property agent Jo Jeong-sik (Jung Moon-sung), the third member of their trio, the loud singing and jangly dancing is occasionally overbearing. But when the trot is switched out for classical music, the tone veers in a pensive and heartfelt direction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/08/40322504-8879-4bfe-aea4-fff3b0d0aded_4266f226.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sung-hang’s past and the emotion buried deep inside him suddenly emerges at the end of episode two when, on a quiet night beside the Cheonggyecheon stream in Central Seoul, he walks by a piano which beckons him to play.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His fingers stroke the keys, plays a quiet few bars and pauses before launching into a brash and complex piano sonata that screams of deep-seated pain and suffering.</p>Vaguely aloof and brilliant but also dependable, Sung-han is a familiar character for Cho, who we last saw as a genius time-travel scientist in the disappointing series <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Sisyphus: The Myth</span></a>. It is another smooth and inviting turn from Cho, and not one that is likely to pose him many challenges.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/08/c6b748b3-d444-417f-9acb-1f8cff1a9c38_d7701b69.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Not seen since Hold Me Tight in 2018, Han is the show’s co-star as the disgraced radio DJ. Given that her divorce proceedings conclude within the opening weekend of episodes, time will tell how her role develops in the series – though it is safe to assume that Seo-jin could be a love interest for Sung-han.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like other Korean legal dramas, Divorce Attorney Shin proceeds in a vaguely episodic manner, with Sung-han taking on various cases, while we can expect his submerged past to steadily bubble to the surface through the show’s 12-episode run.</p>With so many <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">legal dramas</span></a> on Korean schedules these days, the show has its work cut out, but the smooth performances and its emotional core fuelled by classical music may be enough to help it stand out in a crowded field.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Divorce Attorney Shin is streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLhuvM6pZqRllKeurq2OmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkWppcG5pZLumwMWloLFlm2Kxs63MmmSdoaakv6SxjJqrraeio7K6edKhoKdlk528br%2FErqWgZaekvG64xJqbrGWWpLmsv9hmo56fkaF6pb7ApphmqJmWu6q%2F02arrqqemrFuuMCwsJ6q</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
